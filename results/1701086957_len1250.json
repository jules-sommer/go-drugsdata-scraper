These are plant products of low molecular weight formed primarily from oxidative coupling of two p-propylphenol moieties. They can also be described as micromolecules with two phenylpropanoid units coupled together. They can be attached in various manners, like C5-C5', C8-C8'. Most known natural lignans are oxidized at C9 and C9´ and, based upon the way in which oxygen is incorporated into the skeleton and on the cyclization patterns, a wide range of lignans of very different structural types can be formed.",
