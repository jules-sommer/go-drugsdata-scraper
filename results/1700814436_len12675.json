Ethanolamine antihistamines have significant antimuscarinic activity and produce marked sedation in most patients. In addition to the usual allergic symptoms, the drug also treats irritant cough and nausea, vomiting, and vertigo associated with motion sickness. It also is used commonly to treat drug-induced extrapyramidal symptoms as well as to treat mild cases of Parkinson's disease. Rather than preventing the release of histamine, as do cromolyn and nedocromil, carbinoxamine competes with free histamine for binding at HA-receptor sites. Carbinoxamine competitively antagonizes the effects of histamine on HA-receptors in the GI tract, uterus, large blood vessels, and bronchial muscle. Ethanolamine derivatives have greater anticholinergic activity than do other antihistamines, which probably accounts for the antidyskinetic action of carbinoxamine.\n",

Lithium can also be used to augment other antidepressant drugs. It is also sometimes prescribed as a preventive treatment for migraine disease and cluster headaches. The active principle in these salts is the lithium ion Li+, which having a smaller diameter, can easily displace K+ and Na+ and even Ca+2, in spite of its greater charge, occupying their sites in several critical neuronal enzymes and neurotransmitter receptors.\n",

CZEN-002 modulates inflammatory and immune responses. It has also been shown to kill Candida albicans (C. albicans), a single-celled fungal organism that causes a variety of infections, including vaginitis. This organism can invade tissues and produce fatal infections in individuals with compromised immune systems such as those suffering from HIV/AIDS or undergoing organ or bone transplants. The antimicrobial activity of CZEN-002 is unique in that it does not depend on direct damage to the microbial membrane. It appears that CZEN-002 works on a receptor in yeast that has yet to be identified. \nStudies attempting to understand the candidacidal activity of derivatives of alpha-MSH have focused on the alpha-MSH amino acid sequence (6-13), which contains the invariant core sequence His-Phe-Arg-Trp (6-9) that is important for binding to the known melanocortin receptors. A second focus was on the sequence Lys-Pro-Val (11-13) that is known to be important for antimicrobial activity. \n",

Dapagliflozin doses of 5 or 10 mg per day in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus for 12 weeks resulted in excretion of approximately 70 grams of glucose in the urine per day at Week 12. A near-maximum glucose excretion was observed at the dapagliflozin daily dose of 20 mg. This urinary glucose excretion with dapagliflozin also results in increases in urinary volume. After discontinuation of dapagliflozin, on average, the elevation in urinary glucose excretion approaches baseline by about 3 days for the 10 mg dose.10\nDapagliflozin was not associated with clinically meaningful prolongation of QTc interval at daily doses up to 150 mg (15 times the recommended maximum dose) in a study of healthy subjects.

Dapsone is the principal drug in a multidrug regimen recommended by the World Health Organization for the treatment of leprosy. As an anti-infective agent, it is also used for treating malaria and, recently, for Pneumocystic carinii pneumonia in AIDS patients. Dapsone is absorbed rapidly and nearly completely from the gastrointestinal tract. Dapsone is distributed throughout total body water and is present in all tissues. However, it tends to be retained in skin and muscle and especially in the liver and kidney: traces of the drug are present in these organs up to 3 weeks after therapy cessation.\n",

        "pharmacodynamics": "Cabergoline stimulates centrally-located dopaminergic receptors resulting in a number of pharmacologic effects. Five dopamine receptor types from two dopaminergic subfamilies have been identified. The dopaminergic D1 receptor subfamily consists of D1 and D5 subreceptors, which are associated with dyskinesias. The dopaminergic D2 receptor subfamily consists of D2, D3 and D4 subreceptors, which are associated with improvement of symptoms of movement disorders. Thus, agonist activity specific for D2 subfamily receptors, primarily D2 and D3 receptor subtypes, are the primary targets of dopaminergic antiparkinsonian agents. It is thought that postsynaptic D2 stimulation is primarily responsible for the antiparkinsonian effect of dopamine agonists, while presynaptic D2 stimulation confers neuroprotective effects. This semisynthetic ergot derivative exhibits potent agonist activity on dopamine D2- and D3-receptors. It also exhibits: agonist activity (in order of decreasing binding affinities) on 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)2B, 5-HT2A, 5-HT1D, dopamine D4, 5-HT1A, dopamine D1, 5-HT1B and 5-HT2C receptors and antagonist activity on α2B, α2A, and α2C receptors. Parkinsonian Syndrome manifests when approximately 80% of dopaminergic activity in the nigrostriatal pathway of the brain is lost. As this striatum is involved in modulating the intensity of coordinated muscle activity (e.g. movement, balance, walking), loss of activity may result in dystonia (acute muscle contraction), Parkinsonism (including symptoms of bradykinesia, tremor, rigidity, and flattened affect), akathesia (inner restlessness), tardive dyskinesia (involuntary muscle movements usually associated with long-term loss of dopaminergic activity), and neuroleptic malignant syndrome, which manifests when complete blockage of nigrostriatal dopamine occurs. High dopaminergic activity in the mesolimbic pathway of the brain causes hallucinations and delusions; these side effects of dopamine agonists are manifestations seen in patients with schizophrenia who have overractivity in this area of the brain. The hallucinogenic side effects of dopamine agonists may also be due to 5-HT2A agonism. The tuberoinfundibular pathway of the brain originates in the hypothalamus and terminates in the pituitary gland. In this pathway, dopamine inhibits lactotrophs in anterior pituitary from secreting prolactin. Increased dopaminergic activity in the tuberoinfundibular pathway inhibits prolactin secretion. \n",

Following injection or oral administration, single photon emission computer tomography (SPECT) imaging is performed using a gamma camera to detect technetium-99m decay. This is possible as Technetium-99m decays by isomeric transition to technetium-99 through the release of a gamma ray. Depending on site of administration and intended usage, Technetium 99m sulfur colloid enters the capillaries and is transported to the lymph nodes (subcutaneous injection), mixes with peritoneal fluid (intraperitoneal injection), is taken up by reticulocytes (intravenous injection), or enters the gastroesphageal tract (oral administration).\n",

It is highly lipophilic, allowing it to cross the blood-brain barrier more easily than other thiamine derivatives. Although its clinical efficacy is not yet defined, sulbutiamine is used to treat asthenia. While its other uses include improvement of erectile dysfunction and reduction of psycho-behavioural inhibition, sulbutiamine showed evidence of modulatory effect on dopaminergic and glutamatergic cortical transmissions. The chronic administration of the drug has demonstrated to improve long term memory formation in mice.\n",

The discovery and research of this drug began in the early 1990s, after the intravenous administration of radiolabelled ezetimibe in rats revealed that it was being localized within enterocytes of the intestinal villi - this prompted studies investigating the effect of ezetimibe on intestinal cholesterol absorption.3 Ezetimibe is used as an adjunctive therapy to a healthy diet to lower cholesterol levels in primary hyperlipidemia, mixed hyperlipidemia, homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH), and homozygous sitosterolemia (phytosterolemia).5\nUnlike other classes of cholesterol-reducing compounds including statins and bile acid sequestrants, ezetimibe has a distinct mechanism of action involving the sterol transporter Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1), and is unique in that it does not affect the absorption of fat-soluble nutrients such as fat-soluble vitamins, triglycerides, or bile acids.4 In genetically NPC1L1-deficient mice, a 70% reduction in intestinal cholesterol absorption was seen, and these mice were insensitive to ezetimibe treatment - it was determined based on these findings that NPC1L1 plays an essential role in promoting intestinal cholesterol uptake via an ezetimibe-sensitive pathway.3 By interfering with the intestinal uptake of cholesterol and phytosterols, ezetimibe reduces the delivery of intestinal cholesterol to the liver.5\n",

Moreover, women who are affected by this condition can suffer for up to six to ten years and visit multiple physicians before receiving a proper diagnosis 4,5,6. Subsequently, as Orilissa (elagolix) was approved by the FDA under priority review 7, this expedited new approval gives healthcare professionals another valuable option for treating the potentially unmet needs of women who are affected by endometriosis, depending on their specific type and severity of endometriosis pain.\n",

It works by promoting the excretion of sodium ions and water while decreasing the potassium excretion in the distal part of the nephron in the kidneys by working on the lumenal side.2 Since it acts on the distal nephron where only a small fraction of sodium ion reabsorption occurs, triamterene is reported to have limited diuretic efficacy.11 Due to its effects on increased serum potassium levels, triamterene is associated with a risk of producing hyperkalemia. Triamterene is a weak antagonist of folic acid, and a photosensitizing drug.12 \nTriamterene was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in the U.S. in 1964.12 Currently, triamterene is used in the treatment of edema associated with various conditions as monotherapy and is approved for use with other diuretics to enhance diuretic and potassium-sparing effects.15 It is also found in a combination product with hydrochlorothiazide that is used for the management of hypertension or treatment of edema in patients who develop hypokalemia on hydrochlorothiazide alone.\n",

It is currently used for the Urea Breath Test (UBT) and is available as a rapid diagnostic test (marketed as Pranactin-Citric) for the detection of Helicobacter pylori infections. H pylori is a common stomach bacteria that has been linked to a variety of upper gastrointestinal disorders such as gastritis, gastric and peptic ulcers, stomach cancer, and gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid-tissue (MALT) lymphoma. The UBT is indicated to confirm H. pylori infection and to monitor post-treatment for its eradication. \nRadiolabelled urea is available in two forms as 13C and 14C. Both forms can be used within the Urea Breath Test, however some may prefer 13C as it is non-radioactive compared to 14C, which may be preferable in pregnant women and children.\nThe Urea Breath Test is based on the ability of the H. pylori enzyme urease to cleave urea into ammonia and carbon dioxide. As the urease enzyme is not present in mammalian cells, the presence of urease (and the products of urea cleavage) in the stomach is evidence that H. pylori bacteria are present. To detect H. pylori, urea labeled with 13C is swallowed by the patient. If gastric urease from H. pylori is present, urea is split to form CO2 and NH3 at the interface between the gastric epithelium and lumen and 13CO2 is absorbed into the blood and exhaled in the breath. Exhaled breath samples can then be collected and measured for the presence of radioactivity.\n",

Orally absorbed GFT14 has absolutely no structural link with current treatments for dyslipidemia (statin or fibrate based).

Clomifene can lead to multiple ovulation, and hence increase the risk of conceiving twins. In comparison to purified FSH, the rate of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome is low. There may be an increased risk of ovarian cancer and weight gain. Clomifene is capable of interacting with estrogen-receptor-containing tissues, including the hypothalamus, pituitary, ovary, endometrium, vagina, and cervix. It may compete with estrogen for estrogen-receptor-binding sites and may delay replenishment of intracellular estrogen receptors. Clomifene initiates a series of endocrine events culminating in a preovulatory gonadotropin surge and subsequent follicular rupture. The first endocrine event, in response to a course of clomifene therapy, is an increase in the release of pituitary gonadotropins. This initiates steroidogenesis and folliculogenesis resulting in growth of the ovarian follicle and an increase in the circulating level of estradiol. Following ovulation, plasma progesterone and estradiol rise and fall as they would in a normal ovulatory cycle.\n",

In contrast, the newly approved filgotinib is a highly selective JAK1 inhibitor.3 JAK2 and JAK3 play important roles in both immune and hematologic functions; therefore, selectivity for JAK1 aims to improve the safety profile of filgotinib while maintaining clinical efficacy.3 Filgotinib is currently reserved for patients who cannot tolerate DMARDs, or who have been unable to achieve remission in response to one or more DMARDs.10\n",

The necessity for follow-up treatment may lead to challenges with patient adherence, and resistance to agents like permethrin and pyrethrins/piperonyl butoxide may be significant in some areas.3 \nInvestigations into novel ovicidal treatments revealed that several metalloproteinase enzymes were critical to the egg hatching and survival of head lice, and these enzymes were therefore identified as a potential therapeutic target.1 Abemetapir is an inhibitor of these metalloproteinase enzymes, and the first topical pediculicide to take advantage of this novel target. The improved ovicidal activity (90-100% in vitro) of abemetapir allows for a single administration, in contrast to many other topical treatments, and its novel and relatively non-specific mechanism may help to curb the development of resistance to this agent.1\nAbametapir was first approved for use in the United States under the brand name Xeglyze on July 27, 2020.6\n",

If heated to its boiling point, it may undergo potentially explosive thermal decomposition. Hydrogen peroxide is formed in the body of mammals during reduction of oxygen either directly in a two-electron transfer reaction 4. As a natural product of metabolism, it readily undergoes decomposition by catalase in normal cells 4. \nDue to its potent and broad-spectrum antimicrobial actions, hydrogen peroxide is used in both liquid and gas form for preservative, disinfection and sterilization applications as an oxidative biocide 1. It is used in industrial and cosmetic applications as a bleaching agent. Hydrogen peroxide is also considered as a generally recognized as safe compound by the FDA 4; it is used as an antimicrobial agent in starch and cheese products, and as an oxidizing and reducing agent in products containing dried eggs, dried egg whites, and dried egg yolks.\n",

Structurally, hydromorphone derived from morphine in the modification of the hydroxyl group in the carbon 6 to a carbonyl and the absence of a double bond between the carbon 7 and 8. Due to these modifications, it presents a very high potency and comparable side effect profile to the parent compound.2 Even though hydromorphone does not present a 6-hydroxyl group, it is categorized under the family of phenanthrenes and it is considered a chemical under the schedule II (medical purposes with high addiction potential).3\nThe first reported approved product containing hydromorphone in the form of hydromorphone hydrochloride was developed by Fresenius Kabi USA and FDA approved in 1984.9\n",

On the same trials, hydromorphone was shown to produce respiratory depression, lower cognitive function, miosis, mydriasis, constipation, hypotension, and vertigo but to present a reduced incidence of pruritus (which indicates a lower release of histamine) and nausea.7\nThe respiratory depression is known to be caused by the effect on the brain stem respiratory centers as well as to a reduction in the responsiveness of this brain stems to increase carbon dioxide tension.10\n",

During sympathetic stimulation or when renal blood pressure or blood flow is reduced, renin is released from the granular cells of the juxtaglomerular apparatus in the kidneys. In the blood stream, renin cleaves circulating angiotensinogen to ATI, which is subsequently cleaved to ATII by ACE. ATII increases blood pressure using a number of mechanisms. First, it stimulates the secretion of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex. Aldosterone travels to the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) and collecting tubule of nephrons where it increases sodium and water reabsorption by increasing the number of sodium channels and sodium-potassium ATPases on cell membranes. Second, ATII stimulates the secretion of vasopressin (also known as antidiuretic hormone or ADH) from the posterior pituitary gland. ADH stimulates further water reabsorption from the kidneys via insertion of aquaporin-2 channels on the apical surface of cells of the DCT and collecting tubules. Third, ATII increases blood pressure through direct arterial vasoconstriction. Stimulation of the Type 1 ATII receptor on vascular smooth muscle cells leads to a cascade of events resulting in myocyte contraction and vasoconstriction. In addition to these major effects, ATII induces the thirst response via stimulation of hypothalamic neurons. ACE inhibitors inhibit the rapid conversion of ATI to ATII and antagonize RAAS-induced increases in blood pressure. ACE (also known as kininase II) is also involved in the enzymatic deactivation of bradykinin, a vasodilator. Inhibiting the deactivation of bradykinin increases bradykinin levels and may sustain its effects by causing increased vasodilation and decreased blood pressure.\n",

Aminoglycosides work by binding to the bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit, causing misreading of t-RNA, leaving the bacterium unable to synthesize proteins vital to its growth. Aminoglycosides are useful primarily in infections involving aerobic, Gram-negative bacteria, such as Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, and Enterobacter. In addition, some mycobacteria, including the bacteria that cause tuberculosis, are susceptible to aminoglycosides. Infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria can also be treated with aminoglycosides, but other types of antibiotics are more potent and less damaging to the host. In the past the aminoglycosides have been used in conjunction with penicillin-related antibiotics in streptococcal infections for their synergistic effects, particularly in endocarditis. Aminoglycosides are mostly ineffective against anaerobic bacteria, fungi and viruses.\n",

In addition to its broad spectrum of action, ciclopirox also exerts antibacterial activity against many Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Furthermore, the anti-inflammatory effects of ciclopirox have been demonstrated in human polymorphonuclear cells, where ciclopirox has inhibited the synthesis of prostaglandin and leukotriene.

The serotonin 5-HT3 receptors are located on the nerve terminals of the vagus in the periphery, and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema Label, 3,4. The temporal relationship between the emetogenic action of emetogenic drugs and the release of serotonin, as well as the efficacy of antiemetic agents, suggest that chemotherapeutic agents release serotonin from the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine by causing degenerative changes in the GI tract Label, 3,4. The serotonin then stimulates the vagal and splanchnic nerve receptors that project to the medullary vomiting center, as well as the 5-HT3 receptors in the area postrema, thus initiating the vomiting reflex, causing nausea and vomiting Label, 3,4.\nMoreover, the effect of ondansetron on the QTc interval was evaluated in a double-blind, randomized, placebo and positive (moxifloxacin) controlled, crossover study in 58 healthy adult men and women 11,12. Ondansetron was tested at single doses of 8 mg and 32 mg infused intravenously over 15 minutes 11,12. At the highest tested dose of 32 mg, prolongation of the Fridericia-corrected QTc interval (QT/RR0.33=QTcF) was observed from 15 min to 4 h after the start of the 15 min infusion, with a maximum mean (upper limit of 90% CI) difference in QTcF from placebo after baseline-correction of 19.6 (21.5) msec at 20 min 11,12. At the lower tested dose of 8 mg, QTc prolongation was observed from 15 min to 1 h after the start of the 15-minute infusion, with a maximum mean (upper limit of 90% CI) difference in QTcF from placebo after baseline-correction of 5.8 (7.8) msec at 15 min 11,12. The magnitude of QTc prolongation with ondansetron is expected to be greater if the infusion rate is faster than 15 minutes 11,12. The 32 mg intravenous dose of ondansetron must not be administered 11,12. No treatment-related effects on the QRS duration or the PR interval were observed at either the 8 or 32 mg dose 11,12.\nAn ECG assessment study has not been performed for orally administered ondansetron 11,12. On the basis of pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modelling, an 8 mg oral dose of ondansetron is predicted to cause a mean QTcF increase of 0.7 ms (90% CI -2.1, 3.3) at steady-state, assuming a mean maximal plasma concentration of 24.7 ng/mL (95% CI 21.1, 29.0) 11,12. The magnitude of QTc prolongation at the recommended 5 mg/m2 dose in pediatrics has not been studied, but pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling predicts a mean increase of 6.6 ms (90% CI 2.8, 10.7) at maximal plasma concentrations 11,12. \nIn healthy subjects, single intravenous doses of 0.15 mg/kg of ondansetron had no effect on esophageal motility, gastric motility, lower esophageal sphincter pressure, or small intestinal transit time 10. Multiday administration of ondansetron has been shown to slow colonic transit in healthy subjects 10. Ondansetron has no effect on plasma prolactin concentrations 10.\n",

For the treatment of relapsed CLL, it is currently indicated as a second-line agent in combination with rituximab in patients for whom rituximab alone would be considered appropriate therapy due to other co-morbidities, while in the treatment of FL and SLL it is intended to be used in patients who have received at least two prior systemic therapies. More specifically, idelalisib targets P110δ, the delta isoform of the enzyme phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, also known as PI-3K. The PI-3Ks are a family of enzymes involved in cellular functions such as cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, motility, survival and intracellular trafficking, which in turn are involved in cancer. In contrast to the other class IA PI3Ks p110α and p110β, p110δ is principally expressed in leukocytes (white blood cells) and is important for the function of T cells, B cell, mast cells and neutrophils. By inhibiting this enzyme, idelalisib induces apoptosis of malignant cells and inhibits several cell signaling pathways, including B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling and C-X-C chemokine receptors type 5 and type 4 signalling, which are involved in trafficking and homing of B-cells to the lymph nodes and bone marrow. Treatment of lymphoma cells with idelalisib has been shown to result in inhibition of chemotaxis and adhesion, and reduced cell viability.\n",

It acts as a competitive acetylcholine antagonist on neuromuscular junctions, displacing acetylcholine (hence competitive) from its post-synaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. It is, unlike suxamethonium, a non-depolarising agent, which means, that it causes no spontaneous depolarisations upon association with the nicotinic receptor in neuromuscular junction, thus producing no muscle fasciculations upon administration. Pancuronium has no hormonal activity. It exerts slight vagolytic activity (i.e. diminishing activity of the vagus nerve) and no ganglioplegic (i.e., blocking ganglions) activity.\n",

It has been proposed that by interacting with the ETC, idebenone increases ATP production required for mitochondrial function, reduces free radicals, inhibits lipid peroxidation, and consequently protects the lipid membrane and mitochondria from oxidative damage 2. More specifically, idebenone is thought to transfer electrons directly to complex III of the mitochondrial ETC, thereby circumventing complex I and restoring cellular energy (ATP) generation 4. \nDue to its ability to reduce oxidative damage and improve ATP production, idebenone was originally investigated for its potential use in Alzheimer's Disease and other cognitivie disorders 3. Lack of improvement in cognitive function halted its production for these conditions, however it continues to be investigated for use in other conditions associated with mitochondrial damage. \nIdebenone is currently only indicated for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of visual impairment in adolescent and adult patients with\nLeber’s Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON). LHON is a mitochondrially inherited degeneration of retinal ganglion cells, resulting in acute central vision loss. Due to its biochemical mode of action, it's thought that idebenone may re-activate viable-but-inactive retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in LHON patients 4. It is not currently approved for use by either the Food and Drug Administration (USA) or Health Canada.\n",

        "background": "Dronabinol (marketed as Marinol) is a synthetic form of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ⁹-THC), the primary psychoactive component of cannabis (marijuana). THC demonstrates its effects through weak partial agonist activity at Cannabinoid-1 (CB1R) and Cannabinoid-2 (CB2R) receptors, which results in the well-known effects of smoking cannabis such as increased appetite, reduced pain, and changes in emotional and cognitive processes. Due to its evidence as an appetite stimulant and an anti-nauseant, Dronabinol is approved for use in anorexia associated with weight loss in patients with AIDS and for the treatment of nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy in patients who have failed to respond adequately to conventional antiemetic treatments Label.\nTetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) are the two most abundant cannabinoids found naturally in the resin of the marijuana plant, both of which are pharmacologically active due to their interaction with cannabinoid receptors that are found throughout the body 4. While both CBD and THC are used for medicinal purposes, they have different receptor activity, function, and physiological effects. If not provided in their activated form (such as through synthetic forms like Dronabinol or Nabilone), THC and CBD are obtained through conversion from their precursors, tetrahydrocannabinolic acid-A (THCA-A) and cannabidiolic acid (CBDA), through decarboxylation reactions. This can be achieved through heating, smoking, vaporization, or baking of dried unfertilized female cannabis flowers.\nFrom a pharmacological perspective, Cannabis' diverse receptor profile explains its potential application for such a wide variety of medical conditions. Cannabis contains more than 400 different chemical compounds, of which 61 are considered cannabinoids, a class of compounds that act upon endogenous cannabinoid receptors of the body 1. The endocannabinoid system is widely distributed throughout the central and peripheral nervous system (via the Cannabinoid Receptors CB1 and CB2) and plays a role in many physiological processes such as inflammation, cardiovascular function, learning, pain, memory, stress and emotional regulation, and the sleep/wake cycle among many others 2. CB1 receptors are found in both the central and peripheral nervous system, and are most abundant in the hippocampus and amygdala, which are the areas of the brain responsible for short-term memory storage and emotional regulation. CB2 receptors are mainly located in the peripheral nervous system and can be found on lymphoid tissue where they are involved in regulation of immune function 3.\n",

Its effects on blood pressure are inconsistent, but subjects have experienced orthostatic hypotension and/or syncope upon abrupt standing.8\nDronabinol also demonstrates reversible effects on appetite, mood, cognition, memory, and perception. These phenomena appear to be dose-related, increasing in frequency with higher dosages, and subject to great inter-patient variability. After oral administration, dronabinol capsules have an onset of action of approximately 0.5 to 1 hour and a peak effect at 2 to 4 hours. Duration of action for psychoactive effects is 4 to 6 hours, but the appetite stimulant effect of dronabinol may continue for 24 hours or longer after administration.8\nTachyphylaxis and tolerance develop to some of the cardiovascular and CNS pharmacologic effects of dronabinol with chronic use, suggesting an indirect effect on sympathetic neurons. In a study of the pharmacodynamics of chronic dronabinol exposure, healthy male subjects (N = 12) received 12 times the maximum dose for anorexia associated with weight loss in patients with AIDS of dronabinol capsules in divided doses for 16 days. An initial tachycardia induced by dronabinol was replaced successively by normal sinus rhythm and then bradycardia. A decrease in supine blood pressure, made worse by standing, was also observed initially. These\nsubjects developed tolerance to the cardiovascular and subjective adverse CNS effects of dronabinol within 12 days of treatment initiation.8 \nTachyphylaxis and tolerance do not appear to develop to the appetite stimulant effect of dronabinol. In clinical studies of dronabinol capsules in AIDS patients, at the recommended dosage, the appetite stimulant effect was sustained for up to five months.8\n",

        "background": "Synthetic conjugated estrogens, B tablets contain a blend of ten synthetic estrogenic substances. The estrogenic substances are: sodium estrone sulfate, sodium equilin sulfate, sodium 17α-dihydroequilin sulfate, sodium 17α-estradiol sulfate, sodium 17β­ dihydroequilin sulfate, sodium 17α-dihydroequilenin sulfate, sodium 17β-dihydroequilenin sulfate, sodium equilenin sulfate, sodium 17β-estradiol sulfate, and sodium Δ8,9-dehydroestrone sulfate. This blend of ten estrogen derivatives are plant-derived forms of endogenous estrogens and contain many of the same compounds as the Conjugated Equine Estrogens (CEEs), although they are not considered to be equivalent. Available as the product Cenestin (FDA), this combination of plant-derived estrogenic compounds is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms, vulvovaginal atrophy, vaginal dryness, and paint with intercourse associated with menopause. \nAll estrogen products mimic the effects of endogenous estrogens in the body which are responsible for the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics. Estrogens act by binding to estrogen receptors on a wide variety of tissues in the body and modulating the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) through a negative feedback mechanism. Prior to menopause, the primary source of estrogen is the ovarian follicle, which secretes 70-500 micrograms of estradiol daily, depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle. However, once a woman stops ovulating there is a sharp decline in the production of progesterone and estradiol by the ovaries and a consequent fluctuation in LH and FSH due to a lack of feedback control. This shift in hormone production is largely responsible for many of the symptoms experienced during and after menopause and includes hot flashes and other vasomotor symptoms, painful intercourse, vaginal dryness, and vulvovaginal atrophy. These symptoms are able to be reduced by replacing many of the hormones lost during and following menopause with synthetic or naturally occurring forms, in a therapy known as Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT).\nPharmacologic estrogen products are available in a variety of formats. Although many of them contain several compounds in common (such as the estrogen derivatives sodium estrone sulfate and sodium equilin sulfate), they vary by their original source (such as horse-, human-, or plant-derived), and the remaining mixture of estrogenic derivatives. Conjugated Equine Estrogens (CEEs) are derived from the urine of pregnant mares and contain a blend of at least 10 estrogen derivatives. Marketed under the brand name Premarin, CEEs are the most frequently used form of conjugated estrogens. There is currently no generic form of CEEs available as a detailed analytical characterization of the active ingredients or of their estrogenic activity is not available at this time. Conjugated estrogens are also available in a plant-derived synthetic form that replicates the naturally occurring, horse-derived forms. Available as either \"Synthetic Conjugated Estrogens, A\" containing 9 estrogen derivatives (available as Cenestin) or as \"Synthetic Conjugated Estrogens, B\" containing 10 estrogen derivatives (available as Enjuvia), these products are isolated as precursors from yam or soy plants and then chemically modified to mimic the products available in their naturally occurring form.\n",

The prevalence of allergic rhinitis in the United States is about 15% according to physician diagnoses, and up to 30%, according to self-reported nasal symptoms. Allergic rhinitis is associated with multiple missed or unproductive days at work and school, problems with sleep, and other difficulties with day to day activities for many individuals 3. Furthermore, some antihistamine agents that are used to treat this condition cause undesirable, sedating effects 4. \nCetirizine is one of the first second-generation H1 antihistamines (SGAHs) formulated to selectively inhibit the H1 receptor without sedating effects 2.\n",

There is a deficit of noradrenaline as well as of dopamine in Parkinson's disease and it has been proposed that this underlies the sudden transient freezing seen usually in advanced disease.\nThough L-DOPS has been used in Japan and Southeast Asia already for some time, it is also currently in clinical trials at the phase III point in the United States (U.S.), Canada, Australia, and throughout Europe. Provided L-DOPS successfully completes clinical trials, it could be approved for the treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (NOH) as early as 2011. Additionally, phase II clinical trials for intradialytic hypotension are also underway. Chelsea Therapeutics obtained orphan drug status (ODS) for L-DOPS in the U.S. for NOH, and that of which associated with Parkinson's disease , pure autonomic failure, and multiple system atrophy, and is the pharmaceutical company developing it in that country.\n",

        "background": "CRx-401 is a novel insulin sensitizer designed to provide anti-diabetic activity without promoting weight gain. It consists of a low dose of the analgesic diflunisal in conjunction with a modified-release therapeutic dose of bezafibrate, an anti-cholesterol agent. In third-party clinical studies, the dose of bezafibrate contained in CRx-401 has been observed to have a positive impact on cellular pathways that influence glycemic and lipid profiles, and this dose has proven to be well tolerated in clinical trials. Unlike other NSAIDs, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, the dose of diflunisal in CRx-401 has demonstrated in preclinical studies the ability to synergistically enhance the anti-diabetic effects of bezafibrate through novel disease-targeted mechanisms.\n",

The skeleton acts as a major mineral storage site for the element and releases Ca2+ ions into the bloodstream under controlled conditions. Circulating calcium is either in the free, ionized form or bound to blood proteins such as serum albumin. Although calcium flow to and from the bone is neutral, about 5 mmol is turned over a day. Bone serves as an important storage point for calcium, as it contains 99% of the total body calcium. Low calcium intake may also be a risk factor in the development of osteoporosis. The best-absorbed form of calcium from a pill is a calcium salt like carbonate or phosphate. Calcium gluconate and calcium lactate are absorbed well by pregnant women. Seniors absorb calcium lactate, gluconate and citrate better unless they take their calcium supplement with a full breakfast.\n",

        "pharmacodynamics": "Hydroflumethiazide is an oral thiazide used to treat hypertension and edema. High blood pressure adds to the workload of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. High blood pressure may also increase the risk of heart attacks. Like other thiazides, Hydroflumethiazide promotes water loss from the body (diuretics). Thiazides inhibit Na+/Cl- reabsorption from the distal convoluted tubules in the kidneys. Thiazides also cause loss of potassium and an increase in serum uric acid. Thiazides are often used to treat hypertension, but their hypotensive effects are not necessarily due to their diuretic activity. Thiazides have been shown to prevent hypertension-related morbidity and mortality although the mechanism is not fully understood. Thiazides cause vasodilation by activating calcium-activated potassium channels (large conductance) in vascular smooth muscles and inhibiting various carbonic anhydrases in vascular tissue.\n",

It is essential for life and regulates or supports a variety of important cardiovascular, metabolic, immunologic and homeostatic functions. Topical hydrocortisone is used for its anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive properties to treat inflammation due to corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses. Glucocorticoids are a class of steroid hormones characterised by an ability to bind with the cortisol receptor and trigger a variety of important cardiovascular, metabolic, immunologic and homeostatic effects. Glucocorticoids are distinguished from mineralocorticoids and sex steroids by having different receptors, target cells, and effects. Technically, the term corticosteroid refers to both glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids, but is often used as a synonym for glucocorticoid. Glucocorticoids suppress cell-mediated immunity. They act by inhibiting genes that code for the cytokines IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-alpha, the most important of which is the IL-2. Reduced cytokine production limits T cell proliferation. Glucocorticoids also suppress humoral immunity, causing B cells to express lower amounts of IL-2 and IL-2 receptors. This diminishes both B cell clonal expansion and antibody synthesis. The diminished amounts of IL-2 also leads to fewer T lymphocyte cells being activated.\n",

        "background": "Paritaprevir is a direct acting antiviral medication used as part of combination therapy to treat chronic Hepatitis C, an infectious liver disease caused by infection with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients 8. Treatment options for chronic Hepatitis C have advanced significantly since 2011, with the development of Direct Acting Antivirals (DAAs) such as paritaprevir. As a newer generation and directly acting HCV antiviral, paritaprevir products have better Sustained Virological Response (SVR) rates, higher barriers to resistance, fewer side effects, and a reduced pill burden compared to older agents such as Boceprevir, Telaprevir, Peginterferon alfa-2a, Peginterferon alfa-2b, and Ribavirin. By combining multiple antiretroviral medications into fixed dose products, the viral lifecycle can be targeted at multiple stages while simultaneously reducing the risk of developing resistant viral strains 7. Within Canada and the United States, paritaprevir is currently available in three fixed dose products: Viekira Pak (FDA), Technivie (FDA and Health Canada), and Holkira Pak (Health Canada).\nMore specifically, paritaprevir prevents viral replication by inhibiting the NS3/4A serine protease of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Label. Following viral replication of HCV genetic material and translation into a single polypeptide, Nonstructural Protein 3 (NS3) and its activating cofactor Nonstructural Protein 4A (NS4A) are responsible for cleaving genetic material into the following structural and nonstructural proteins required for assembly into mature virus: NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B 6. By inhibiting viral protease NS3/4A, paritaprevir therefore prevents viral replication and function. \nIn a joint recommendation published in 2016, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommend Paritaprevir as a first line therapy option when used in combination with other antivirals for genotypes 1a, 1b, and 48. Depending on the genotype, Paritaprevir is often used in combination with other antivirals such as Ombitasvir, Dasabuvir, Ritonavir, and Ribavirin, with the intent to cure, or achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR), after 12 weeks of daily therapy. SVR and eradication of HCV infection is associated with significant long-term health benefits including reduced liver-related damage, improved quality of life, reduced incidence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma, and reduced all-cause mortality 4. Treatment with direct acting antivirals such as paritaprevir is associated with very minimal side effects, with the most common being headache and fatigue Label. Lack of significant side effects and short duration of therapy is a considerable advantage over older interferon-based regimens, which were limited by infusion site reactions, reduced blood count, and neuropsychiatric effects 5. \nParitaprevir first came on the market as a fixed-dose combination product with Ombitasvir, Dasabuvir, and Ritonavir as the FDA-approved product Viekira Pak. First approved in December 2014, Viekira Pak is indicated for the treatment of HCV genotype 1b without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis, and when combined with Ribavirin for the treatment of HCV genotype 1a without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis.\nParitaprevir is also available as a fixed-dose combination product with Ombitasvir and Ritonavir as the FDA- and Health Canada-approved product Technivie. First approved in July 2015, Technivie is indicated in combination with Ribavirin for the treatment of patients with genotype 4 chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis.\nIn Canada, paritaprevir is also available as a fixed-dose combination product with Ombitasvir, Dasabuvir, and Ritonavir as the Health Canada-approved, commercially available product Holkira Pak. First approved in January 2015, Holkira Pak is indicated for the treatment of HCV genotype 1b with or without cirrhosis, and when combined with Ribavirin for the treatment of HCV genotype 1a with or without cirrhosis.\n",

It is used as a gastric decontaminant and emergency medication to treat poisonings following excessive oral ingestion of certain medications or poisons by absorbing most drugs and toxins. However its effects is rendered poor on some compounds including strong acids or bases, methanol and substances with limited absorptive capacity (including iron, lithium, arsenic). It works by binding to the poison in the gastric contents in a reversible fashion thus may be adminstered together with a cathartic to reduce the small intestine transit time. The clinical applications of activated charcoal occured in the early 1800's. While this management for acute poisoning is considered fairly invasive, it is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines that includes the most important medications needed in a basic health system.\n",

Atracurium can be used most advantageously if muscle twitch response to peripheral nerve stimulation is monitored to assess degree of muscle relaxation. The duration of neuromuscular block produced by Atracurium is approximately one third to one half the duration of block by d-tubocurarine, metocurine, and pancuronium at initially equipotent doses. As with other nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockers, the time to onset of paralysis decreases and the duration of maximum effect increases with increasing doses of Atracurium. Repeated administration of maintenance doses of Atracurium has no cumulative effect on the duration of neuromuscular block if recovery is allowed to begin prior to repeat dosing. Moreover, the time needed to recover from repeat doses does not change with additional doses. Repeat doses can therefore be administered at relatively regular intervals with predictable results.\n",

Atrial fibrillation is a common sustained arrhythmia where the treatment primarily focuses on stroke prevention and symptom management. It is managed by rate control, rhythm control, prevention of thromboembolic events, and treatment of the underlying disease.1 Similar to amiodarone, dronedarone is a multichannel blocker that works to control rhythm and rate in atrial fibrillation.2 It meets criteria of all four Vaughan Williams antiarrhythmic drug classes by blocking sodium, potassium, and calcium ion channels and inhibiting β-adrenergic receptors.1,13 \nDronedarone is a related benzofuran compound to amiodarone but its chemical structure lacks iodine moieties which are associated with amiodarone-induced thyroid problems.1,8 Additionally, the methyl sulfonyl group in its structure renders dronedarone to be more lipophilic with a shorter half-life than amiodarone.1 This ultimately leads to reduced tissue accumulation of the drug and decreased risk for organ toxicities, such as thyroid and pulmonary toxicities.8 Commonly marketed as Multaq®, dronedarone was approved by the FDA in July 2009 and Health Canada in August 2009. A safety concern for the risk of drug-induced hepatocellular injury has been issued following marketing of dronedarone.11\n",

In another model, it prevents ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation.9 Dronedarone moderately prolongs the QTc interval by about 10 ms on average.13 Dronedarone decreases arterial blood pressure and reduces oxygen consumption. It reduces myocardial contractility with no change in left ventricular ejection fraction. Dronedarone vasodilates coronary arteries through activation of the nitric oxide pathway.9 In clinical studies, dronedarone reduced incidence of hospitalizations for acute coronary syndromes and reduced incidence of stroke.3 Dronedarone exhibits antiadrenergic effects by reducing alpha-adrenergic blood pressure response to epinephrine and beta 1 and beta 2 responses to isoproterenol.9 \nDronedarone was shown to inhibit triiodothyronine (T3) signalling by binding to TRα1 but much less so to TRβ1.7 The treatment of dronedarone in patients with severe heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction was associated with increased early mortality related to the worsening of heart failure.4 In animal studies, the use of dronedarone at doses equivalent to the recommended human doses was associated with fetal harm. In clinical studies and postmarketing reports, dronedarone was shown to cause hepatocellular liver injury and pulmonary toxicities, such as interstitial lung disease, pneumonitis, and pulmonary fibrosis.13 Compared to its related compound amiodarone, dronedarone has a faster onset and offset of actions with a shorter elimination half-life and low tissue accumulation.1,8\n",

It is essential for life and regulates or supports a variety of important cardiovascular, metabolic, immunologic and homeostatic functions. Topical hydrocortisone is used for its anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive properties to treat inflammation due to corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses. Glucocorticoids are a class of steroid hormones characterised by an ability to bind with the cortisol receptor and trigger a variety of important cardiovascular, metabolic, immunologic and homeostatic effects. Glucocorticoids are distinguished from mineralocorticoids and sex steroids by having different receptors, target cells, and effects. Technically, the term corticosteroid refers to both glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids, but is often used as a synonym for glucocorticoid. Glucocorticoids suppress cell-mediated immunity. They act by inhibiting genes that code for the cytokines IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-alpha, the most important of which is the IL-2. Reduced cytokine production limits T cell proliferation. Glucocorticoids also suppress humoral immunity, causing B cells to express lower amounts of IL-2 and IL-2 receptors. This diminishes both B cell clonal expansion and antibody synthesis. The diminished amounts of IL-2 also leads to fewer T lymphocyte cells being activated.\n",

Once released, histamine can react with local or widespread tissues through histamine receptors.

Histamine also increases vascular permeability and potentiates pain. Mequitazine is a histamine H1 antagonist.

        "pharmacodynamics": "Following oral administration, fosinopril is rapidly and completely hydrolyzed to its principle active metabolite, fosinoprilat. Hydrolysis is thought to occur in the gastrointestinal mucosa and liver. Fosinoprilat is a competitive inhibitor of ACE, a peptidyl dipeptidase that is part of the RAAS. The RAAS is a homeostatic mechanism for regulating hemodynamics, water and electrolyte balance. During sympathetic stimulation or when renal blood pressure or blood flow is reduced, renin is released from the granular cells of the juxtaglomerular apparatus in the kidneys. In the blood stream, renin cleaves circulating angiotensinogen to ATI, which is subsequently cleaved to ATII by ACE. ATII increases blood pressure using a number of mechanisms. First, it stimulates the secretion of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex. Aldosterone travels to the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) and collecting tubule of nephrons where it increases sodium and water reabsorption by increasing the number of sodium channels and sodium-potassium ATPases on cell membranes. Second, ATII stimulates the secretion of vasopressin (also known as antidiuretic hormone or ADH) from the posterior pituitary gland. ADH stimulates further water reabsorption from the kidneys via insertion of aquaporin-2 channels on the apical surface of cells of the DCT and collecting tubules. Third, ATII increases blood pressure through direct arterial vasoconstriction. Stimulation of the Type 1 ATII receptor on vascular smooth muscle cells leads to a cascade of events resulting in myocyte contraction and vasoconstriction. In addition to these major effects, ATII induces the thirst response via stimulation of hypothalamic neurons. ACE inhibitors inhibit the rapid conversion of ATI to ATII and antagonize RAAS-induced increases in blood pressure. ACE (also known as kininase II) is also involved in the enzymatic deactivation of bradykinin, a vasodilator. Inhibiting the deactivation of bradykinin increases bradykinin levels and may further sustain the effects of fosinoprilat by causing increased vasodilation and decreased blood pressure. \n",

Gout is closely associated with hyperuricemia. Febuxostat works by inhibiting the activity of an enzyme that is responsible for the synthesis of uric acid, thereby reducing serum uric acid levels.5 \nIn February 2019, a black box warning for febuxostat was added, based on the findings of a post-market clinical study (the CARES trial) where there was an increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) fatal outcomes in patients with gout and known cardiovascular disease treated with febuxostat, when compared to those treated with allopurinol. The manufacturer and the FDA advise health professionals to limit the use of febuxostat to second-line therapy in patients who have inadequate response or intolerance to allopurinol, and to avoid the use of febuxostat in patients with cardiovascular diseases.1,9\n",

Niacin exists in different forms including nicotinic acid, nicotinamide and other derivatives such as inositol nicotinate. It is associated with reduced flushing compared to other vasodilators by being broken down into the metabolites and inositol at a slower rate. Nicotinic acid plays an essential role in many important metabolic processes and has been used as lipid-lowering agent. Inositol nicotinate is prescribed in Europe under the name Hexopal as a symptomatic treatment for severe intermittent claudication and Raynaud’s phenomenon.\n",

In particular, the specific levobupivacaine enantiomer is a worthwhile pursuit because it demonstrates less vasodilation and possesses a greater length of action in comparison to bupivacaine. It is approximately 13 per cent less potent (by molarity) than racemic bupivacaine.Levobupivacaine is indicated for local anaesthesia including infiltration, nerve block, ophthalmic, epidural and intrathecal anaesthesia in adults; and infiltration analgesia in children. When administered appropriately, the occurrence of adverse effects is not anticipated much if at all. In general, the majority of potential adverse effects are predominantly associated with inappropriate administration methods that may cause systemic exposure and/or toxicity associated with overexposure to an anesthetic.

Within the vascular tree, H1- receptor antagonists inhibit both the vasoconstrictor and vasodilator effects of histamine. Depending on the dose, H1- receptor antagonists can produce CNS stimulation or depression. Most antihistamines exhibit central and/or peripheral anticholinergic activity. Antihistamines act by competitively blocking H1- receptor sites. Antihistamines do not pharmacologically antagonize or chemically inactivate histamine, nor do they prevent the release of histamine.\n",

Strontium chloride 89 is a divalent ion, similar to calcium, therefore it is taken up by sites of active osteogenesis. This relieves bone metastatic-driven pain withouth generating important side effects and it also presents a very little radioprotection concern.10 Once combined with external beam radiotherapy, strontium chloride 89 can emit β particules with a maximum range in tissue of 6-8mm. This radiation is capable to reduce new bone metastases and produces an analgesic role.11\n"

The use of an EP2 receptor agonist such as omidenepag represents an alternative in these scenarios. Omidenepag IOP-lowering effect is comparable to the one observed with latanoprost.2 In 2018, omidenepag isopropyl was approved in Japan for the treatment of glaucoma and ocular hypertension.5 In September 2022, the FDA approved the use of omidenepag isopropyl.6\n",

The pigmentation of the iris is likely to be permanent, while the pigmentation of the periorbital tissue and eyelash are reversible in most patients.

High serum phosphorus can precipitate serum calcium resulting in ectopic calcification. When the product of serum calcium and phosphorus concentrations (Ca x P) exceeds 55 mg2/dL2, there is an increased risk that ectopic calcification will occur. Hyperphosphatemia plays a role in the development of secondary hyperparathyroidism in renal insufficiency. An increase in parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels is characteristic of patients with chronic renal failure. Increased levels of PTH can lead to osteitis fibrosa, a bone disease. A decrease in serum phosphorus may decrease serum PTH levels. Treatment of hyperphosphatemia includes reduction in dietary intake of phosphate, inhibition of intestinal phosphate absorption with phosphate binders, and removal of phosphate with dialysis. Sevelamer taken with meals has been shown to decrease serum phosphorus concentrations in patients with ESRD who are on hemodialysis. In vitro studies have shown that the capsule and tablet formulations bind phosphate to a similar extent. Sevelamer treatment also results in a lowering of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and total serum cholesterol levels.\n",

        "background": "Daridorexant, formerly known as nemorexant, is a selective dual orexin receptor antagonist used to treat insomnia. Insomnia is characterized by difficulties with sleep onset and/or sleep maintenance and impairment of daytime functioning. It chronically affects the person's daily functioning and long-term health effects, as insomnia is often associated with comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, and depression. Conventional treatments for insomnia include drugs targeting gamma-aminobutyric acid type-A (GABA-A), serotonin, histamine, or melatonin receptors; however, undesirable side effects are frequently reported, such as next-morning residual sleepiness, motor incoordination, falls, memory and cognitive impairment. Novel drugs that target orexin receptors gained increasing attention after discovering the role of orexin signalling pathway in wakefulness and almorexant, an orexin receptor antagonist that improved sleep. Daridorexant was designed via an intensive drug discovery program to improve the potency and maximize the duration of action while minimizing next-morning residual activity.1 \nDaridorexant works on orexin receptors OX1R and OX2R to block the binding of orexins, which are wake-promoting neuropeptides and endogenous ligands to these receptors. Daridorexant reduces overactive wakefulness: in the investigational trials, daridorexant reportedly improved sleep and daytime functioning in patients with insomnia.1 It was approved by the FDA on January 10, 2022, under the name QUVIVIQ.6 as the second orexin receptor antagonist approved to treat insomnia following suvorexant.2 Daridorexant was approved by the European Commission on May 3, 2022, as the first dual orexin receptor antagonist approved in the market,8 and by Health Canada on April 26, 2023.9\n",

Patient-reported daytime sleepiness was also reportedly reduced.6 At a dose four times the maximum recommended dose, daridorexant does not prolong the QTc interval to any clinically relevant extent.5\nDaridorexant is currently being assessed for a controlled substance schedule in the US. In a human abuse potential study, daridorexant showed some abuse potential at doses higher than the recommended dose (100-150 mg), indicated by similar “drug liking” ratings to zolpidem (30 mg) and suvorexant in recreational sedative drug users.5 However, at clinically relevant concentrations, daridorexant does not bind to abuse-associated CNS targets.1 In animal studies and clinical trials evaluating physical dependence, chronic administration of daridorexant did not produce withdrawal signs or symptoms upon drug discontinuation, indicating that the drug does not produce physical dependence.5\n",

The antiepileptics, as a drug class, are routinely used in the treatment of a number of disease states in addition to epilepsy. Ezogabine is highly efficacious in a broad-spectrum of in vivo epilepsy and seizure models. A comparison of antiepileptic form activity of ezogabine with that of conventional anticonvulsants in in vitro models suggests that retigabine is especially likely to be useful in the treatment of pharmacoresistant epilepsy. Retigabine clearly attenuates pain-like behaviors in various animal models of neuropathic pain; it may also prove to be useful in treatment of clinical anxiety disorders. Clinical data obtained thus far indicate that retigabine is well tolerated in humans when titrated up to its therapeutic dose range. No tolerance, drug dependence, or withdrawal liability has been reported. Thus, retigabine may prove to be useful in the treatment of a diverse range of disease states in which neuronal hyperexcitability is a common underlying factor.\n",

This observation is currently being explored in clinical trials.3 Angiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, kininase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium. Telmisartan works by blocking the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone secretory effects of angiotensin II.2,5\n",

They prevent these substances becoming incorporated in to DNA during the \"S\" phase (of the cell cycle), stopping normal development and division. Cytarabine is metabolized intracellularly into its active triphosphate form (cytosine arabinoside triphosphate). This metabolite then damages DNA by multiple mechanisms, including the inhibition of alpha-DNA polymerase, inhibition of DNA repair through an effect on beta-DNA polymerase, and incorporation into DNA. The latter mechanism is probably the most important. Cytotoxicity is highly specific for the S phase of the cell cycle.\n",

        "molecule": "Cannabidiol",
        "cas": "13956-29-1",
        "background": "Cannabidiol, or CBD, is one of at least 85 active cannabinoids identified within the Cannabis plant. It is a major phytocannabinoid, accounting for up to 40% of the Cannabis plant's extract, that binds to a wide variety of physiological targets of the endocannabinoid system within the body. Although the exact medical implications are currently being investigated, CBD has shown promise as a therapeutic and pharmaceutical drug target. In particular, CBD has shown promise as an analgesic, anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant, anxiolytic, antipsychotic and has shown neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant activity, among other currently investigated uses 6,5. CBD's exact place within medical practice is still currently hotly debated, however as the body of evidence grows and legislation changes to reflect its wide-spread use, public and medical opinion have changed significantly with regards to its usefulness in a number of medical conditions ranging from anxiety to epilepsy.\nFrom a pharmacological perspective, Cannabis' (and CBD's) diverse receptor profile explains its potential application for such a wide variety of medical conditions. Cannabis contains more than 400 different chemical compounds, of which 61 are considered cannabinoids, a class of compounds that act upon endogenous cannabinoid receptors of the body 11. Cannabinoid receptors are utilized endogenously by the body through the endocannabinoid system, which includes a group of lipid proteins, enzymes, and receptors that are involved in many physiological processes. Through its modulation of neurotransmitter release, the endocannabinoid system regulates cognition, pain sensation, appetite, memory, sleep, immune function, and mood among many other bodily systems. These effects are largely mediated through two members of the G-protein coupled receptor family, cannabinoid receptors 1 and 2 (CB1 and CB2)12,8. CB1 receptors are found in both the central and peripheral nervous systems, with the majority of receptors localized to the hippocampus and amygdala of the brain. Physiological effects of using cannabis make sense in the context of its receptor activity as the hippocampus and amygdala are primarily involved with regulation of memory, fear, and emotion. In contrast, CB2 receptors are mainly found peripherally in immune cells, lymphoid tissue, and peripheral nerve terminals 9.\nTetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) are two types of cannabinoids found naturally in the resin of the marijuana plant, both of which interact with the cannabinoid receptors that are found throughout the body. Although THC and CBD have been the most studied cannabinoids, there are many others identified to date including cannabinol (CBN), cannabigerol (CBG), Cannabidivarin (CBDV), and Tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV) that can be found within the medical cannabis 10. While both CBD and THC are used for medicinal purposes, they have different receptor activity, function, and physiological effects. If not provided in their activated form (such as through synthetic forms of THC like Dronabinol or Nabilone), THC and CBD are obtained through conversion from their precursors, tetrahydrocannabinolic acid-A (THCA-A) and cannabidiolic acid (CBDA), through decarboxylation reactions. This can be achieved through heating, smoking, vaporization, or baking of dried unfertilized female cannabis flowers.\nThe primary psychoactive component of Cannabis, delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC), demonstrates its effects through weak partial agonist activity at Cannabinoid-1 (CB1R) and Cannabinoid-2 (CB2R) receptors. This activity results in the well-known effects of smoking cannabis such as increased appetite, reduced pain, and changes in emotional and cognitive processes. In contrast to THC's weak agonist activity, CBD has been shown to act as a negative allosteric modulator of the cannabinoid CB1 receptor, the most abundant G-Protein Coupled Receptor (GPCR) in the body 5. Allosteric regulation is achieved through the modulation of receptor activity on a functionally distinct site from the agonist or antagonist binding site which is clinically significant as direct agonists (such as THC) are limited by their psychomimetic effects such as changes to mood, memory, and anxiety5. \nIn addition to the well-known activity on CB1 and CB2 receptors, there is further evidence that CBD also activates 5-HT1A/2A/3A serotonergic and TRPV1–2 vanilloid receptors, antagonizes alpha-1 adrenergic and µ-opioid receptors, inhibits synaptosomal uptake of noradrenaline, dopamine, serotonin and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and cellular uptake of anandamide, acts on mitochondria Ca2+ stores, blocks low-voltage-activated (T-type) Ca2+ channels, stimulates activity of the inhibitory glycine-receptor, and inhibits activity of fatty amide hydrolase (FAAH) 1,2.\nCBD is currently available in Canada within a 1:1 formulation with tetrahydrocannbinol (THC) (as the formulation known as \"nabiximols\") as the brand name product Sativex. It is approved for use as adjunctive treatment for symptomatic relief of spasticity in adult patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Sativex was also given a conditional Notice of Compliance (NOC/c) for use as adjunctive treatment for the symptomatic relief of neuropathic pain in adult patients with multiple sclerosis and as adjunctive analgesic treatment for moderate to severe pain in adult patients with advanced cancer 18.\nIn April 2018, a Food and Drug Administration advisory panel unanimously recommended approval of Epidiolex (cannabidiol oral solution) for the treatment of two rare forms of epilepsy - Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome, which are among the two most difficult types of epilepsy to treat 21,19. Epidiolex was granted Orphan Drug designation as well as Fast Track Approval from the FDA for further study in these hard to treat conditions. Notably, phase 3 clinical trials of Epidiolex have demonstrated clinically significant improvement in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome 20. On June 25th, 2018, Epidiolex was approved by the FDA to be the first CBD-based product available on the US market.\n",

Dosulepin inhibits the reuptake of biogenic amines, increasing available neurotransmitter levels at the synaptic cleft. The use of dosulepsin is only recommended in patients who are intolerant or unresponsive to alternative antidepressant therapies. Dosulepsin is a thio derivative of Amitriptyline with a similar efficacy to that of Amitriptyline, and also exhibits anticholinergic, antihistamine and central sedative properties 8.\nIts hydrochloride form is a common active ingredient in different drug formulations.\n",

In apoptosis, phosphatidyl serine is transferred to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. This is part of the process by which the cell is targeted for phagocytosis. PS has been shown to slow cognitive decline in animal models. PS has been investigated in a small number of double-blind placebo trials and has been shown to increase memory performance in the elderly. Because of the potentail cognitive benefits of phosphatidylserine, the substance is sold as a dietary supplement to people who believe they can benefit from an increased intake.\nThe dietary supplement was originally processed from bovine sources however Prion disease scares in the 1990s outlawed this process, and a soy-based alternative was adopted.\n",

Type 2 diabetes is a metabolic disorder with increasing prevalences worldwide; it is characterized by insulin resistance in accordance with progressive β cell failure and long-term microvascular and macrovascular complications that lead to co-morbidities and mortalities. Sulfonylureas are one of the insulin secretagogues widely used for the management of type 2 diabetes to lower blood glucose levels. The main effect of SUs is thought to be effective when residual pancreatic β-cells are present,3 as they work by stimulating the release of insulin from the pancreatic beta cells and they are also thought to exert extra-pancreatic effects, such as increasing the insulin-mediated peripheral glucose uptake.2 \nGlimepiride works by stimulating the secretion of insulin granules from pancreatic islet beta cells by blocking ATP-sensitive potassium channels (KATP channels) and causing depolarization of the beta cells. Compared to glipizide, another second SU drug, glimepiride has a longer duration of action. It is sometimes classified as a third-generation SU because it has larger substitutions than other second-generation SUs.1 Compared to other SUs, glimepiride was associated with a lower risk of developing hypoglycemia and weight gain in clinical trials 2 as well as fewer cardiovascular effects than other SUs due to minimal effects on ischemic preconditioning of cardiac myocytes.1 It is effective in reducing fasting plasma glucose, postprandial glucose, and glycosylated hemoglobin levels and is considered to be a useful, cost-effective treatment option for managing type 2 diabetes mellitus.1 Glimepiride was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States in 1995 for the treatment of T2DM. It is commonly marketed under the brand name Amaryl as oral tablets and is typically administered once daily.\n",

A multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluated the efficacy of glimepiride (1–8 mg) as monotherapy titrated over 10 weeks compared with placebo in T2DM subjects who were not controlled by diet alone.1 In this study, there was a reduction in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) by 46 mg/dL, post-prandial glucose (PPG) by 72 mg/dL, and HbA1c by 1.4% more than the placebo.1 In another randomized study comprising of patients with T2DM receiving either placebo or one of the three doses (1, 4, or 8 mg) of glimepiride during a 14-week study period, all glimepiride regimens significantly reduced FPG, PPG, and HbA1c values (P \u003c 0.001) compared to placebo by the end of the study period.1 The 4- and 8-mg doses of glimepiride were more effective than the 1-mg dose; however, the 4-mg dose provided a nearly maximal antihyperglycemic effect.1\n",

It was initially approved by the FDA in 1991 4.\nIt is primarily used for the treatment of respiratory, enteric and genitourinary infections and may be used instead of other macrolides for some sexually transmitted and enteric infections. It is structurally related to erythromycin 2.\nAzithromycin [9-deoxo-9a-aza-9a-methyl-9a-homoerythromycin] is a part of the azalide subclass of macrolides, and contains a 15-membered ring, with a methyl-substituted nitrogen instead of a carbonyl group at the 9a position on the aglycone ring, which allows for the prevention of its metabolism. This differentiates azithromycin from other types of macrolides 4.\nIn March 2020, a small study was funded by the French government to investigate the treatment of COVID-19 with a combination of azithromycin and the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine. The results were positive, all patients taking the combination were virologically cured within 6 days of treatment, however, larger studies are required.9\n",

It also exports acyl groups from subcellular organelles and from cells to urine before they accumulate to toxic concentrations. Lack of carnitine can lead to liver, heart, and muscle problems. Carnitine deficiency is defined biochemically as abnormally low plasma concentrations of free carnitine, less than 20 µmol/L at one week post term and may be associated with low tissue and/or urine concentrations. Further, this condition may be associated with a plasma concentration ratio of acylcarnitine/levocarnitine greater than 0.4 or abnormally elevated concentrations of acylcarnitine in the urine. Only the L isomer of carnitine (sometimes called vitamin BT) affects lipid metabolism. The \"vitamin BT\" form actually contains D,L-carnitine, which competitively inhibits levocarnitine and can cause deficiency. Levocarnitine can be used therapeutically to stimulate gastric and pancreatic secretions and in the treatment of hyperlipoproteinemias.\n",

The inhibition of serum thromboxane B2 (TXB2) levels was higher than 85%. Hence, morniflumate is demonstrated to reduce arachidonic acid metabolism, by exerting its effects on cyclooxygenase and 5-lipoxygenase. This characteristic might provide a better approach for anti-inflammatory therapy 1.\nIn several animal models orally administered morniflumate, the beta-morpholinoethyl ester of niflumic acid, proved almost equal to the parent compound in anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic activity with the absence of gastric irritating/ulcerogenic effects of its acidic parent compound 7.\n",

By inhibiting the breakdown of acetylcholine in the neuromuscular junction, they increase signalling and relieve symptoms.2,10,11 Pyridostigmine is the current drug of choice, with superior pharmacokinetics and reduced side effects compared to neostigmine.10,11 In addition to treating myasthenia gravis, pyridostigmine is used to reverse neuromuscular blocks, relieve symptoms in congenital myasthenic syndromes, and protect against certain nerve agents, notably during the Gulf War.3,4,11,12\nPyridostigmine was granted initial FDA approval on April 6, 1955, as an oral tablet.

Belonging to the azaspirodecanedione drug class,2 buspirone is a serotonin 5-HT1A receptor agonist that is not chemically or pharmacologically related to benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and other sedative/anxiolytic drugs.13 Unlike many drugs used to treat anxiety, buspirone does not exhibit anticonvulsant, sedative, hypnotic, and muscle-relaxant properties. Due to these characteristics, buspirone been termed 'anxioselective'.1 First synthesized in 1968 then patented in 1975,10 it is commonly marketed under the brand name Buspar®. Buspirone was first approved in 1986 by the FDA 4 and has been used to treat anxiety disorders, such as generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and relieve symptoms of anxiety. It has also been used as a second-line therapy for unipolar depression when the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) is deemed clinically inadequate or inappropriate.10 The potential use of buspirone in combination with melatonin in depression and cognitive impairment via promoting neurogenesis has also been investigated.4\n",

This is due to the lack of effects on GABA receptors.1,10 Buspirone also does not exhibit any anticonvulsant or muscle-relaxing properties,5 but may interfere with arousal reactions due to its inhibitory action on the aactivity of noradrenergic locus coerulus neurons.9\nDespite its clinical effectiveness in generalized anxiety, buspirone demonstrated limited clinical effectiveness on panic disorders, severe anxiety, phobias, and obsessive compulsive disorders.4,9 The clinical effectiveness of the long-term use of buspirone, for more than 3 to 4 weeks, has not demonstrated in controlled trials but there were no observable significant adverse events in patients receiving buspirone for a year in a study of long-term use.13\n",

Additionally, the concomitant use of agents that can alter serum phosphate levels before the initial erdafitinib dose increase period based on serum phosphate levels was also avoided.1,3,6\nFurthermore, based on the evaluation of QTc interval in an open-label, dose escalation, and dose expansion study in 187 patients with cancer, erdafitinib had no large effect (i.e., \u003e 20 ms) on the QTc interval.6 \n",

It is a non-ergot dopamine agonist drug that is efficacious in treating various Parkinson's symptoms such as tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia (slow movement) 6. It was first approved by the FDA in 1997 12. Parkinson's Disease is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders and causes a high level of disability in patients 2, leading to increased difficulty in performing activities of daily living due to symptoms that progress over time 3. The prevalence of Parkinson's Disease worldwide has increased from approximately 2.5 million in 1990 to about 6.1 million in 2016 4. This increase may be attributed to an aging population along with other contributing factors 4.\nIn addition to the above FDA approval for Parkinson's Disease, pramipexole was also approved by the FDA in 2006 for the treatment of Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) 8. RLS is a sleep-related disorder characterized by unpleasant sensations in the lower extremities, often accompanied by an uncontrollable urge to move the legs 9.\n",

Restless legs syndrome is thought to occur, in part, through dysfunction of the dopaminergic system, resulting in unpleasant lower extremity symptoms 9, 15. \nOther effects\nIn addition to the abovementioned effects, animal studies demonstrate that pramipexole blocks dopamine synthesis, release, and turnover. Additionally, this drug is neuroprotective to dopamine neuron degeneration after ischemia or methamphetamine neurotoxicity 15. \n",

        "pharmacodynamics": "Bexarotene is a member of a subclass of retinoids that selectively activate retinoid X receptors (RXRs). These retinoid receptors have biologic activity distinct from that of retinoic acid receptors (RARs). Bexarotene is indicated for the treatment of cutaneous manifestations of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in patients who are refractory to at least one prior systemic therapy. Bexarotene selectively binds and activates retinoid X receptor subtypes (RXRα, RXRβ, RXRγ). RXRs can form heterodimers with various receptor partners such as retinoic acid receptors (RARs), vitamin D receptor, thyroid receptor, and peroxisome proliferator activator receptors (PPARs). Once activated, these receptors function as transcription factors that regulate the expression of genes that control cellular differentiation and proliferation. Bexarotene inhibits the growth in vitro of some tumor cell lines of hematopoietic and squamous cell origin. It also induces tumor regression in vivo in some animal models.\n",

For example, the antibiotic may influence components of the acute inflammatory cytokine response and enhances neutrophil phagocytic destruction of pathogens.1,4\nFosfomycin penetrates biofilms effectively and is capable of not only reducing or eliminating microorganisms in biofilms but can also alter the biofilm structure.1,7\n",

Nitisinone inhibits catabolism of tyrosine by preventing the catabolic intermediates. In patients with HT-1, these catabolic intermediates are converted to the toxic metabolites succinylacetone and succinylacetoacetate, which are responsible for the observed liver and kidney toxicity. Succinylacetone can also inhibit the porphyrin synthesis pathway leading to the accumulation of 5-aminolevulinate, a neurotoxin responsible for the porphyric crises characteristic of HT-1.\n",

This action in humans correlates with the relief of migraine headache. In addition to causing vasoconstriction, experimental data from animal studies show that Naratriptan also activates 5-HT1 receptors on peripheral terminals of the trigeminal nerve innervating cranial blood vessels, which may also contribute to the antimigrainous effect of Naratriptan in humans.\n",

Estradiol is the most potent form of all mammalian estrogenic steroids and acts as the major female sex hormone. As a pro-drug of estradiol, estradiol benzoate therefore has the same downstream effects within the body through binding to the Estrogen Receptor (ER) including ERα and ERβ subtypes, which are located in various tissues including in the breasts, uterus, ovaries, skin, prostate, bone, fat, and brain.\nEstradiol is commonly produced with an ester side-chain as endogenous estradiol has very low oral bioavailability on its own (2-10%). First-pass metabolism by the gut and the liver quickly degrades the estradiol molecule before it gets a chance to enter systemic circulation and exert its estrogenic effects 9. Esterification of estradiol aims to improves absorption and bioavailability after oral administration (such as with Estradiol valerate) or to sustain release from depot intramuscular injections (such as with Estradiol Cypionate) through improved lipophilicity. Following absorption, the esters are cleaved, resulting in the release of endogenous estradiol, or 17β-estradiol. Ester pro-drugs of estradiol are therefore considered to be bioidentical forms of estrogen 10.\nEstradiol dienanthate is not currently available in any commercially available products in Canada or the US.\n",

Rezafungin has a half-life higher than 130 hours and can be administered once a week instead of daily. It can only be administered intravenously but does not reach therapeutic concentrations in the central nervous system, eye and urine.1,2 Rezafungin is active against Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Candida parapsilosis and Candida tropicalis, as well as other Candida and Aspergillus spp.2,5\nClinical studies have shown that rezafungin is non-inferior to caspofungin for the treatment of candidaemia and invasive candidiasis.3 In March 2023, the FDA approved rezafungin for injection for the treatment of candidemia and invasive candidiasis in adults with limited or no alternative treatment options.5,6\n",

In clinical trials, plasma concentrations of rimegepant were significantly higher in patients with severe (i.e. Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment - it should therefore be avoided in this population.6 Hypersensitivity reactions have occurred during clinical studies and patients should be made aware of this possibility. Rimegepant should be discontinued immediately if hypersensitivity reaction occurs.6\n",

Due to these properties, curcumin has been investigated for the treatment and supportive care of clinical conditions including proteinuria, breast cancer, multiple myeloma, depression, and Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). Despite proven efficacy against numerous experimental models, poor bioavailability due to poor absorption, rapid metabolism, and rapid systemic elimination have been shown to limit the therapeutic efficacy of curcumin 1.

By inhibiting factor Xa, a key protein in the coagulation cascade, edoxaban prevents the stepwise amplification of protein factors needed to form blood clots. It is indicated to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism (SE) in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) and for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) following 5-10 days of initial therapy with a parenteral anticoagulant. Traditionally, warfarin, a vitamin K antagonist, was used for stroke prevention in these individuals but effective use of this drug is limited by it's delayed onset, narrow therapeutic window, need for regular monitoring and INR testing, and numerous drug-drug and drug-food interactions. This has prompted enthusiasm for newer agents such as dabigatran, apixaban, and rivaroxaban for effective clot prevention. In addition to once daily dosing, the benefits over warfarin also include significant reductions in hemorrhagic stroke and GI bleeding, and improved compliance, which is beneficial as many patients will be on lifelong therapy.\n",

In a June 16 2020 press release highlighting early results of a clinical trial, Randomized Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy (RECOVERY), it was reported that dexamethasone reduced COVID-19 deaths by approximately one-fifth and one-third in patients on oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation, respectively. Dexamethasone was therefore recommended as a life-saving treatment for COVID-19 patients experiencing severe respiratory symptoms.3\n",

        "background": "Macimorelin, a novel and orally active ghrelin mimetic that stimulates GH secretion, is used in the diagnosis of adult GH deficiency (AGHD). More specifically, macimorelin is a peptidomimetic growth hormone secretagogue (GHS) that acts as an agonist of GH secretagogue receptor, or ghrelin receptor (GHS-R1a) to dose-dependently increase GH levels 3. Growth hormone secretagogues (GHS) represent a new class of pharmacological agents which have the potential to be used in numerous clinical applications. They include treatment for growth retardation in children and cachexia associated with chronic disease such as AIDS and cancer. \nGrowth hormone (GH) is classically linked with linear growth during childhood. In deficiency of this hormone, AGHD is commonly associated with increased fat mass (particularly in the abdominal region), decreased lean body mass, osteopenia, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and/or glucose intolerance overtime. In addition, individuals with may be susceptible to cardiovascular complications from altered structures and function 5. Risk factors of AGHD include a history of childhood-onset GH deficiency or with hypothalamic/pituitary disease, surgery, or irradiation to these areas, head trauma, or evidence of other pituitary hormone deficiencies 3. While there are various therapies available such as GH replacement therapy, the absence of panhypopituitarism and low serum IGF-I levels with nonspecific clinical symptoms pose challenges to the detection and diagnosis of AGHD. The diagnosis of AGHD requires biochemical confirmation with at least 1 GH stimulation test 3. Macimorelin is clinically useful since it displays good stability and oral bioavailability with comparable affinity to ghrelin receptor as its endogenous ligand. In clinical studies involving healthy subjects, macimorelin stimulated GH release in a dose-dependent manner with good tolerability 3.\nMacimorelin, developed by Aeterna Zentaris, was approved by the FDA in December 2017 under the market name Macrilen for oral solution.\n",

Treatment options for patients with FOP are extremely limited, although there has been substantial recent interest in novel treatments for this disease.3\nPalovarotene is a selective agonist of retinoic acid receptor gamma (RARγ) belonging to a class of medications known as retinoids, similar in mechanism to drugs like tazarotene or trifarotene, which are derivatives of vitamin A. It first garnered interest as a potential treatment for emphysema but was eventually recognized as a potential novel therapy for patients with FOP.1,2,3 Agonists for retinoic acid receptors have been shown to inhibit chondrogenesis of heterotopic ossification in a transgenic mice model of FOP, with selective RARγ agonists (e.g. palovarotene) demonstrating the greatest efficacy.3\nPalovarotene was approved for use in Canada in January 2022 for the management of heterotopic ossification (HO) in patients with FOP, representing the first global approval for any FOP therapy.4,6 It has been granted rare pediatric disease and breakthrough therapy designations from the US FDA, although a previously submitted NDA was withdrawn in August 2021 pending the resubmission of additional data analyses.5 On August 16, 2023, palovarotene was also approved by the FDA for the management of HO associated with FOP.9\n",

Palovarotene is contraindicated in patients of childbearing potential unless a number of pregnancy prevention strategies are met (e.g. effective contraception, regular pregnancy testing).4\nPalovarotene may also cause a premature physeal closure in growing children. Physeal growth plates should be monitored every 3 months throughout therapy, or more frequently if evidence of adverse effects on growth are observed.4\nAt doses up to 2.5 times the maximum recommended dose, palovarotene does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent.7 \nPalovarotene binds to retinoic acid receptor gamma (RARγ) with a 10-fold greater affinity compared to retinoic acid receptor alpha or beta. In animal models of Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva (BMP implant in WT mouse, Q207D mouse model, R206H mouse model), palovarotene decreased heterotopic ossification (HO) in a dose-dependent manner as well as inflammatory and fibroproliferative responses at the sites of injury. Additionally, palovarotene also outperformed corticosteroids in preventing HO, with a dexamethasone treatment of 4.4 mg/kg/day for 4 days demonstrating no clinical efficacy on heterotropic bone volume.8 \n",

For example, dequalinium can bind to the membrane-proximal external region (MPER) of the spike envelope of the human immunodeficiency virus HIV-1.9\nAs with other quaternary ammonium compounds similar to dequalinium, gram-positive bacteria are more sensitive to dequalinium than gram-negative bacteria.6,10 The bactericidal and fungicidal effects of dequalinium can occur within 30 to 60 minutes.7 According to in vitro studies, the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) for dequalinium against relevant vaginal pathogens ranges from 0.2 to ≥ 1024 µg/mL.10\nThere is evidence that dequalinium exhibits anticancer activity in human leukemia cells: dequalinium induces a cytotoxic effect by altering redox balance, downregulating Raf/MEK/ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt signalling pathways, and promoting apoptosis of leukemic cells.3,4,5 Dequalinium was also shown to block small conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels, called SK channels, which are often expressed in some cancer cells to play a role in cell proliferation and migration.9 One study showed that dequalinium reduced macrophage motility in mice, inhibiting macrophage infiltration of irradiated tumours and attenuating local metastasis.2\nInterestingly, dequalinium was shown to modulate and induce self-oligomerization of alpha-synuclein, a synaptic protein known to cause aggregates in several neurodegenerative disorders. This finding highlights the neuroprotective actions of dequalinium; however, further investigations are warranted as dequalinium is a neurotoxic agent.9\n",

A small amount of ingested codeine is converted to morphine in the body. Codeine increases tolerance to pain, reducing existing discomfort. In addition to decreasing pain, codeine also causes sedation, drowsiness, and respiratory depression 4. \nAntitussive activity\nThis drug has shown antitussive activity in clinical trials 6 and has been effective in cough secondary to tuberculosis and insomnia due to coughing 4. Codeine suppresses the cough reflex through a direct effect on the cough center in the medulla 16.\nEffects on intestinal motility\nCodeine may reduce intestinal motility through both a local and possibly central mechanism of action 17. This may possibly lead to constipation 16. The chronic use of opioids, including codeine sulfate, may lead to obstructive bowel disease, particularly in patients with underlying disorders of intestinal motility Label. \nEffects on the central nervous system\nCodeine phosphate is an opioid analgesic with uses similar to those of morphine, but is much less potent as an analgesic. Its primary site of action is at the mu opioid receptors distributed throughout the central nervous system. The sedative activities of codeine are less potent than those of morphine 16. Codeine may cause respiratory system depression by the activation of μ-opioid receptors at specific sites in the central nervous system 8.\nEffects on blood pressure\nThis drug poses an increased risk of compromised ability to maintain blood pressure due to peripheral vasodilation and other mechanisms Label. \nEffects on chronic cancer pain and other types of pain\nCodeine is an opioid analgesic with similar indications to those of morphine, however, is much less potent in its pain alleviating properties. Its primary action takes place at the mu opioid receptors, which are distributed throughout the central nervous system. The average duration of action is about 4 hours 16.\nRegular dosing of opioid analgesics such as codeine in patients with severe cancer pain has been well documented to improve symptoms 4, 7.\n",

The group oxidronate falls into the category of diphosphonates whose structure allows them to bind to calcium.4 Thus, technetium Tc-99m oxidronate is a powerful detection tool for abnormal osteogenesis by skeletal scintigraphy.5 It was developed by Mallinkrodt nuclear and FDA approved on February 18, 1981.\n",

It relaxes the pupillary sphincter to dilate the pupil.1 The onset of tropicamide‐induced mydriasis is about 10 to 15 minutes,3 with optimal effect occurring 25 to 30 minutes post-administration. Mydriasis caused by tropicamide wears off within four to eight hours, but it was seen up to 24 hours in some individuals. Tropicamide hinders accommodation by causing the contraction of the ciliary muscle. The cycloplegic effect occurs within 20 to minutes following administration, with a duration of action of four to 10 hours. Tropicamide can elevate intraocular pressure.1 The ophthalmic use of tropicamide is not typically associated with serious systemic adverse events.5\nOne randomized pilot study showed that oral tropicamide alleviated perceived symptoms of sialorrhea in patients with Parkinson's Disease: anticholinergics are believed to restore the dopaminergic to cholinergic activity imbalance in neurodegenerative diseases.1 Similarly in one case report, tropicamide administered via ophthalmic solution relieved clozapine-induced sialorrhea.2 Interestingly, in rodent models, tropicamide suppressed drug-induced tremulous jaw movements which are often used as a model of parkinsonian tremor: the significance of this finding requires further investigations.4\n",

It works mostly in the periphery and activates opioid receptors in the intestine rather than the central nervous system (CNS). [3] Difenoxin is also closely related to loperamide, but unlike loperamide it is still capable of crossing the blood brain barrier to produce weak sedative and analgesic effects.

It was initially approved by the FDA in 1995 Label and marketed by GlaxoSmithKline 8. Valacyclovir is the L-valine ester of aciclovir. It is a member of the purine (guanine) nucleoside analog drug class 10. This class of drugs forms an important part of hepatitis, HIV, and cytomegalovirus drug regimens 4.\nOne major use of valacyclovir is the treatment of genital herpes episodes or outbreaks. Genital herpes is a frequently diagnosed sexually transmitted disease which currently affects more than 400 million individuals worldwide. It is caused by infection with the herpes simplex virus (HSV). Infection with this virus is lifelong with periodic episodes of reactivation 5.\n",

The quantitative relationship between the cell culture susceptibility of herpesviruses to antivirals and the clinical response of humans to the same antiviral therapy has not yet been elucidated. Sensitivity testing results, described by the concentration of drug needed to inhibit the growth of the virus by 50% in cell culture (EC50), vary widely depending on various factors Label.\nClinical study results\nFor the various conditions below, clinical study results are summarized as follows Label:\nCold sores\nImmunocompetent volunteers with cold sores were observed following the administration of a 1-day regimen (2 grams of valacyclovir twice a day for 1 day followed by one day of placebo) or a 2-day regimen (2 grams of valacyclovir twice daily for two days). The average duration of cold sore episodes was approximately 1 day shorter in treated subjects when compared to subjects treated with placebo. A 2-day drug administration regimen of valacyclovir did not provide superior benefit over the 1-day regimen. There was no clinically significant difference observed between subjects receiving valacyclovir or placebo in the prevention of progression of cold sore lesions after the papular stage, indicating that timing of valacyclovir administration is an important consideration Label.\nInitial genital herpes episodes\n643 immunocompetent adults with first-episode genital herpes who presented within 72 hours of symptom onset were randomized in a double-blind trial to receive 10 days of valacyclovir 1 gram twice daily (n = 323) or oral acyclovir 200 mg 5 times a day (n = 320). In both groups, the median time to healing of herpetic lesions was measured to be 9 days, and the median time to cessation of pain was found to be 5 days, with the median time to cessation of viral shedding was approximately 3 days.\nRecurrent genital herpes episodes\nThe results of 3 separate studies of patients taking 3 to 5-day regimens of valacyclovir showed an average of 4 days to lesion healing, 2-3 days to resolution of pain associated with the lesions, with an average of 2 days until the cessation of viral shedding Label. These findings showed valacyclovir administration to show superior beneficial effects when compared to the findings associated with placebo administration. \nA note on resistance\nThe resistance of Herpes Simplex Virus and Varicella Zoster Virus to acyclovir can result from qualitative and quantitative changes in the viral TK and/or DNA polymerase. Clinical isolates of VZV with decreased susceptibility to acyclovir have been isolated from patients diagnosed with AIDS. A total of 522 TK-deficient mutants of VZV have been identified in these cases Label. \n",

Nicotinic acetylcholine (nAChR)receptors are found throughout the body, especially on muscle. Stimulation of these receptors causes to muscle contraction. In myasthenia gravis the body's immune system destroys many of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, so that the muscle becomes less responsive to nervous stimulation. Edrophonium chloride increases the amount of acetylcholine at the nerve endings. Increased levels of acetylcholine allow the remaining receptors to function more efficiently.\n",

Toremifene inhibits the induction of rat mammary carcinoma induced by dimethylbenzanthracene (DMBA) and causes the regression of already established DMBA-induced tumors. In this rat model, Toremifene appears to exert its antitumor effects by binding the estrogen receptors. In cytosols derived from human breast adenocarcinomas, Toremifene competes with estradiol for estrogen receptor protein.\n",

It is marketed by the pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline as a stand-alone drug (Avandia) and in combination with metformin (Avandamet) or with glimepiride (Avandaryl). Like other thiazolidinediones, the mechanism of action of rosiglitazone is by activation of the intracellular receptor class of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), specifically PPARγ. Rosiglitazone is a selective ligand of PPARγ, and has no PPARα-binding action. Apart from its effect on insulin resistance, it appears to have an anti-inflammatory effect: nuclear factor kappa-B (NFκB) levels fall and inhibitor (IκB) levels increase in patients on rosiglitazone. Recent research has suggested that rosiglitazone may also be of benefit to a subset of patients with Alzheimer's disease not expressing the ApoE4 allele. This is the subject of a clinical trial currently underway.\n",

In healthy human volunteers, the mean plasma concentration of allantoin is about 2-3 mg/l. During exercise, the plasma allantoin concentration rapidly increases about two fold and remains elevated Label. In human muscle, urate is oxidized to allantoin during such exercise Label. The concentration of allantoin in muscles increases from a resting value of about 5000 ug/kg to about 16000 ug/kg immediately after short-term exhaustive cycling exercise Label. \nMore specifically, allantoin is a diureide of glyoxylic acid that is produced from uric acid. It is a major metabolic intermediate in most organisms. Allantoin is found in OTC cosmetic products and other commercial products such as oral hygiene products, in shampoos, lipsticks, anti-acne products, sun care products, and clarifying lotions 4. Allantoin has also demonstrated to ameliorate the wound healing process in some studies 1.\n",

The main chain of glucose has short branches at frequent intervals which are probably joined by 1:3 and 1:4 glucoside links. The chains can be composed of about 200,000 glucose units.2 Many bacteria, like Leuconostoc, can synthesize dextran from sucrose, and this activity is used commercially to obtain dextran.5\nDextran 40 is a sterile, nonpyrogenic preparation of low molecular weight dextran (average mol. wt. 40,000) in 5% Dextrose Injection or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection. It is administered by intravenous infusion.\nDextran 75 is a complex branched glucan with an average molecular weight 75000 Daltons. It is produced from certain bacteria that with α-1,6 glycosidic linkages between glucose molecules and α-1,3 linkages between branches. When labelled with technetium Tc99m, dextran 75 is intravenously administered as an imaging agent to detect and diagnose conditions in the vascular compartment such as pericardial effusion or ventricular aneurysm.\n",

It is resistant to hydrolysis by beta-lactamase, and has activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. E. coli strains resistant to ceftiofur have been reported. The metabolite desfurolyceftiofur also has antibiotic activity, consequently the two compounds are measured together to monitor for antibiotic activity in the milk.\n",

Unlike proton-pump inhibitors, PCABs are not affected by CYP2C19 genetic polymorphisms and do not require acid-resistant formulations.1 Furthermore, vonoprazan is 350-times more potent than the proton-pump inhibitor lansoprazole, thanks to its ability to accumulate in the gastric corpus mucosa, specifically in the parietal cells.2 \nIn February 2015, vonoprazan was first marketed in Japan for the treatment of acid-related disorders and as an adjunct to Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication.1 In May 2022, the FDA approved the use of vonoprazan in a co-packaged product containing amoxicillin and clarithromycin for the treatment of H. pylori infection.5 Studies have shown that the concomitant use of vonoprazan, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin leads to an H. pylori eradication rate of approximately 90%.3\n",

Due to its good tolerability profile and multimodal mechanism of action, tramadol is generally considered a lower-risk opioid option for the treatment of moderate to severe pain. It is considered a Step 2 option on the World Health Organization's pain ladder and has about 1/10th of the potency of morphine. \nTramadol differs from other traditional opioid medications in that it doesn't just act as a μ-opioid agonist, but also affects monoamines by modulating the effects of neurotransmitters involved in the modulation of pain such as serotonin and norepinpehrine which activate descending pain inhibitory pathways.13 Tramadol's effects on serotonin and norepinephrine mimic the effects of other SNRI antidepressants such as duloxetine and venlafaxine.\nTramadol exists as a racemic mixture consisting of two pharmacologically active enantiomers that both contribute to its analgesic property through different mechanisms and are also themselves metabolized into active metabolites: (+)-tramadol and its primary metabolite (+)-O-desmethyl-tramadol (M1) are agonists of the μ opioid receptor while (+)-tramadol inhibits serotonin reuptake and (-)-tramadol inhibits norepinephrine reuptake. These pathways are complementary and synergistic, improving tramadol's ability to modulate the perception of and response to pain.12,25 \nTramadol has also been shown to affect a number of other pain modulators within the central nervous system as well as non-neuronal inflammatory markers and immune mediators.17,18,20,26,16 Due to the broad spectrum of targets involved in pain and inflammation, it's not surprising that the evidence has shown that tramadol is effective for a number of pain types including neuropathic pain, post-operative pain, lower back pain, as well as pain associated with labour, osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, and cancer. Due to its SNRI activity, tramadol also has anxiolytic, antidepressant, and anti-shivering effects which are all frequently found as comorbidities with pain.16\nSimilar to other opioid medications, tramadol poses a risk for development of tolerance, dependence and abuse. If used in higher doses, or with other opioids, there is a dose-related risk of overdose, respiratory depression, and death.22,30 However, unlike other opioid medications, tramadol use also carries a risk of seizure and serotonin syndrome, particularly if used with other serotonergic medications.23,24\n",

        "pharmacodynamics": "Tramadol modulates the descending pain pathways within the central nervous system through the binding of parent and M1 metabolite to μ-opioid receptors and the weak inhibition of the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin.7,6 \nApart from analgesia, tramadol may produce a constellation of symptoms (including dizziness, somnolence, nausea, constipation, sweating and pruritus) similar to that of other opioids. \nCentral Nervous System\nIn contrast to morphine, tramadol has not been shown to cause histamine release. At therapeutic doses, tramadol has no effect on heart rate, left-ventricular function or cardiac index. Orthostatic hypotension has been observed.29\nTramadol produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centres. The respiratory depression involves both a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem centres to increases in CO2 tension and to electrical stimulation. \nTramadol depresses the cough reflex by a direct effect on the cough centre in the medulla. Antitussive effects may occur with doses lower than those usually required for analgesia.\nTramadol causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but\nare not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origin may produce\nsimilar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in the setting of\noxycodone overdose.30\nSeizures have been reported in patients receiving tramadol within the recommended dosage range. Spontaneous post-marketing reports indicate that seizure risk is increased with doses of tramadol above the recommended range. Risk of convulsions may also increase in patients with epilepsy, those with a history of seizures\nor in patients with a recognized risk for seizure (such as head trauma, metabolic disorders,\nalcohol and drug withdrawal, CNS infections), or with concomitant use of other drugs known to reduce the seizure threshold.30\nTramadol can cause a rare but potentially life-threatening condition resulting from concomitant administration of serotonergic drugs (e.g., anti-depressants, migraine medications). Treatment with the serotoninergic drug should be discontinued if such events (characterized by clusters of symptoms such as hyperthermia, rigidity, myoclonus, autonomic instability with possible rapid fluctuations of vital signs, mental status changes including confusion, irritability, extreme agitation progressing to delirium and coma) occur and supportive symptomatic treatment should be initiated. Tramadol should not be used in combination with MAO inhibitors or serotonin-precursors (such as L-tryptophan, oxitriptan) and should be used with caution in combination with other serotonergic drugs (triptans, certain tricyclic antidepressants, lithium, St. John’s Wort) due to the risk of serotonin syndrome.30\nGastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle\nTramadol causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in gastric, biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of the sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase.30\nEndocrine System\nOpioids may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal or -gonadal axes. Some changes that can be seen include an increase in serum prolactin and decreases in plasma cortisol and testosterone. Clinical signs and symptoms may be manifest from these hormonal changes.30\nHyponatremia has been reported very rarely with the use of tramadol, usually in patients with predisposing risk factors, such as elderly patients and/or patients using concomitant medications that may cause hyponatremia (e.g., antidepressants, benzodiazepines, diuretics). In some reports, hyponatremia appeared to be the result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) and resolved with discontinuation of tramadol and appropriate treatment (e.g., fluid restriction). During tramadol treatment, monitoring for signs and symptoms of hyponatremia is recommended for patients with predisposing risk factors.30\nCardiovascular\nTramadol administration may result in severe hypotension in patients whose ability to maintain adequate blood pressure is compromised by reduced blood volume, or concurrent administration of drugs such as phenothiazines and other tranquillizers, sedative/hypnotics, tricyclic antidepressants or general anesthetics. These patients should be monitored for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dose of tramadol.30\nQTc-Interval Prolongation\nThe maximum placebo-adjusted mean change from baseline in the QTcF interval was 5.5 ms in the 400 mg/day treatment arm and 6.5 ms in the 600 mg/day mg treatment arm, both occurring at the 8h time point. Both treatment groups were within the 10 ms threshold for QT prolongation. Post-marketing experience with the use of tramadol containing products included rare reports of QT prolongation reported with an overdose. Particular care should be exercised when administering tramadol to patients who are suspected to be at an increased risk of experiencing torsade de pointes during treatment with a QTc-prolonging drug.30\nAbuse and Misuse\nLike all opioids, tramadol has the potential for abuse and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death. Therefore, tramadol should be prescribed and handled with caution.30\nDependence/Tolerance\nPhysical dependence and tolerance reflect the neuroadaptation of the opioid receptors to chronic exposure to an opioid and are separate and distinct from abuse and addiction. Tolerance, as well as physical dependence, may develop upon repeated administration of opioids, and are not by themselves evidence of an addictive disorder or abuse. Patients on prolonged therapy should be tapered gradually from the drug if it is no longer required for pain control. Withdrawal symptoms may occur following abrupt discontinuation of therapy or upon administration of an opioid antagonist. Some of the symptoms that may be associated with abrupt withdrawal of an opioid analgesic include body aches, diarrhea, gooseflesh, loss of appetite, nausea, nervousness or restlessness, anxiety, runny nose, sneezing, tremors or shivering, stomach cramps, tachycardia, trouble with sleeping, unusual increase in sweating, palpitations, unexplained fever, weakness and yawning.30\n",

Aerobic Gram-negative microorganisms: Acinetobacter lwoffii, Haemophilus influenzae, and Haemophilus parainfluenzae. Other microorganisms: Chlamydia trachomatis. Moxifloxacin is bactericidal and its mode of action depends on blocking of bacterial DNA replication by binding itself to an enzyme called DNA gyrase, which allows the untwisting required to replicate one DNA double helix into two. Notably the drug has 100 times higher affinity for bacterial DNA gyrase than for mammalian. Moxifloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is active against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.\n",

Fluconazole 50 mg administered daily for up to 28 days in individuals of reproductive age has been show to have no effect on testosterone plasma concentrations of males and plasma concentrations of steroids in females. A 200-400 mg dose of fluconazole showed no clinically relevant effect on steroid levels or on ACTH-stimulated steroid response in healthy males, in one clinical study mentioned on the European Medicines Agency label.26 Other studies have shown no significant effects of fluconazole on steroid levels, further confirming these data.10,18\n",

It emits fluorescence within a range of 790 nm to 815 nm with a peak emission of 796 nm.5 The longer wavelength allows for deeper penetration of the fluorescent light through tissues for better imaging and detection of tumours. Pafolacianine targets the folate receptor alpha (FRα) which is upregulated in numerous epithelial malignancies.3\nOn November 29, 2021, the FDA approved pafolacianine as an adjunct imaging agent for intraoperative identification of malignant lesions in adult patients with ovarian cancer.5 It is currently under investigation for use in FRα-positive pituitary adenoma, lung cancer,4 and renal-cell carcinoma, which is thought to be the second-highest folate receptor-expressing cancer.3\n",

Aztreonam exhibits potent and specific activity in vitro against a wide spectrum of gram-negative aerobic pathogens including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It has no useful activity against gram-positive bacteria or anaerobes, but has very broad spectrum against gram-negative aerobes, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This has given it the nickname \"the magic bullet for aerobic gram-negative bacteria\". Aztreonam, unlike the majority of beta-lactam antibiotics, does not induce beta-lactamase activity and its molecular structure confers a high degree of resistance to hydrolysis by beta-lactamases (such as penicillinases and cephalosporinases) produced by most gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens; it is, therefore, usually active against gram-negative aerobic microorganisms that are resistant to antibiotics hydrolyzed by beta-lactamases. It is active against many strains that are multiply-resistant to other antibiotics, such as certain cephalosporins, penicillin, and aminoglycosides. Aztreonam maintains its antimicrobial activity over a pH range of 6 to 8 in vitro, as well as in the presence of human serum and under anaerobic conditions.\n",

Since PPD, like various other types of depression, is characterized by feelings of sadness, worthlessness or guilt, cognitive impairment, and/or possibly suicidal ideation, it is considered a life-threatening condition 9. Studies have consequently found that PPD can genuinely have profound negative effects on the maternal-infant bond and later infant development 9,1,2. The development and availability of brexanolone for the treatment of PPD in adult females subsequently provides a new and promising therapy where few existed before 8.\nIn particular, the use of brexanolone in treating PPD is surrounded with promise because it acts in part as a synthetic supplement for possible deficiencies in endogenous brexanolone (allopregnanolone) in postpartum women susceptible to PPD whereas many commonly used anti-depressive medications elicit actions that may modulate the presence and activity of substances like serotonin, norepinephrine, and/or monoamine oxidase but do not mediate activities directly associated with PPD like natural fluctuations in the levels of endogenous neuroactive steroids like allopregnanolone 7.\nAnd finally, although brexanolone may also be undergoing clinical trials to investigate its abilities to treat super-refractory status epilepticus, it appears that some such studies have failed to meet primary endpoints that compare success in the weaning of third-line agents and resolution of potentially life-threatening status epilepticus with brexanolone vs. placebo when added to standard-of-care 6.\n",

Though effective for the treatment of asthma, glucocorticoids do not affect asthma symptoms immediately. Maximum improvement in symptoms following inhaled administration of mometasone furoate may not be achieved for 1 to 2 weeks or longer after starting treatment. When glucocorticoids are discontinued, asthma stability may persist for several days or longer. Mometasone has been shown in vitro to exhibit a binding affinity for the human glucocorticoid receptor which is approximately 12 times that of dexamethasone, 7 times that of triamcinolone acetonide, 5 times that of budesonide, and 1.5 times that of fluticasone.

Special care should therefore be exercised when used in elderly patients, individuals with a history of gastrointestinal disease, and those with a history of asthma or significant allergies. Lincomycin for injection may contain benzyl alcohol as a preservative, which has been associated with gasping syndrome in pediatric patients. The serum half-life is extended in patients with hepatic/renal impairment and may require dose adjustments and additional monitoring. Like all antibiotics, lincomycin use may cause overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, which should be considered.10\n",

Although demonstrably effective in treating and maintaining remission for ulcerative colitis, mesalazine has historically faced a number of issues regarding its lack of stability as a pharmaceutical agent 1. Throughout the late seventies and the eighties, important research initiatives developed stable mesalazine formulations like the eudragit-S coating of Asacol brand mesalazine and the Pentasa brand's encapsulation of mesalazine within microgranules 1. In the present day, contemporary research regarding novel methods to stabilize mesalazine continues and interest in the agent's capacity to decrease inflammatory activity and subsequently potentially reduce the risk of colorectal cancer in conditions like ulcerative colitis is maintained.1,2\n",

It is the latter responsible for most of the side effects associated with sulphasalazine therapy, while mesalazine is known to be the active moiety in the treatment of ulcerative colitis 12.\nMesalazine is thought to dampen the inflammatory process through its ability to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, interfere with leukotriene synthesis, and consequent leukocyte migration as well as act as a potent scavenger of free radicals.25 Regardless of the mode of action, mesalazine appears to be active mainly topically rather than systemically.25\nIntraperitoneally administered mesalazine at 30 and 340 mg/kg daily had similar efficacy in attenuating colitis as prednisolone 4 to 550 mg/kg daily given intraperitoneally or sulphasalazine 0.34 to 5 mg/kg given orally in immune complex-induced colitis mice.11 Mesalazine at 5 mmol/L and sulphasalazine 1.5 mmol/L also reversed the increase in water and chloride secretion and decrease the sodium in dinitrochlorbenzene-induced colitis guinea pig.11\n",

It is also produced in small quantities in the testis and the ovary. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) can be converted to testosterone; androstenedione; estradiol; and estrone. Most of DHEA is sulfated (dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate) before secretion.\nIn the United States, DHEA or DHEAS have been advertised with claims that they may be beneficial for a wide variety of ailments. DHEA and DHEAS are readily available in the United States, where they are marketed as over-the-counter dietary supplements. In November 2016, DHEA was approved (as Intrarosa) to treat women experiencing moderate to severe pain during sexual intercourse (dyspareunia), a symptom of vulvar and vaginal atrophy (VVA), due to menopause.\nIn Canada, a prescription is required to buy DHEA.\n",

DHEA is increased by exercise and calorie restriction. Some theorize that the increase in endogenous DHEA brought about by calorie restriction is partially responsible for the longer life expectancy known to be associated with calorie restriction.\n",

        "pharmacodynamics": "Secondary hyperparathyroidism is characterized by an elevation in parathyroid hormone (PTH) associated with inadequate levels of active vitamin D hormone. The source of vitamin D in the body is from synthesis in the skin and from dietary intake. Vitamin D requires two sequential hydroxylations in the liver and the kidney to bind to and to activate the vitamin D receptor (VDR). The endogenous VDR activator, calcitriol [1,25(OH)2 D3], is a hormone that binds to VDRs that are present in the parathyroid gland, intestine, kidney, and bone to maintain parathyroid function and calcium and phosphorus homeostasis, and to VDRs found in many other tissues, including prostate, endothelium and immune cells. VDR activation is essential for the proper formation and maintenance of normal bone. In the diseased kidney, the activation of vitamin D is diminished, resulting in a rise of PTH, subsequently leading to secondary hyperparathyroidism and disturbances in the calcium and phosphorus homeostasis.1 Decreased levels of 1,25(OH)2 D3 have been observed in early stages of chronic kidney disease. The decreased levels of 1,25(OH)2 D3 and resultant elevated PTH levels, both of which often precede abnormalities in serum calcium and phosphorus, affect bone turnover rate and may result in renal osteodystrophy. An in vitro study indicates that paricalcitol is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 or CYP3A at concentrations up to 50 nM (21 ng/mL).\n",

But unlike other drugs, omapatrilat also inhibits another enzyme known as neutral endopeptidase (NEP), which helps blood vessels relax.

Pharmacodynamic properties of midazolam and its metabolites, which are similar to those of other benzodiazepine drugs, include sedative, anxiolytic, amnestic, muscle relaxant, as well as hypnotic activities.20 Benzodiazepines enhance the inhibitory action of the amino acid neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Receptors for GABA are targeted by many important drugs that affect GABA function and are commonly used in the treatment of anxiety disorder, epilepsy, insomnia, spasticity, and aggressive behavior.7\nSedation and memory\nThe onset of sedation after intramuscular administration in adults is 15 minutes, with maximal sedation occurring 30-60 minutes after injection.Label In one study of adults, when tested the following day, 73% of the patients who were administered midazolam intramuscularly had no recollection of memory cards shown 30 minutes following drug administration; 40% had no recollection of the memory cards shown 60 minutes after drug administration. Onset time of sedative effects in pediatric patients begins within 5 minutes and peaks at 15-30 minutes depending upon the dose administered. In the pediatric population, up to 85% had no memory of pictures shown after receiving intramuscular midazolam compared to 5% of the placebo control group.20\nSedation in both adult and pediatric patients is reached within 3 to 5 minutes post intravenous (IV) injection. The time of onset is affected by the dose administered and the simultaneous administration of narcotic pre-medication. Seventy-one (71%) percent of the adult patients in clinical endoscopy studies had no memory of insertion of the endoscope; 82% of the patients had no memory of withdrawal of the endoscope.14\nAnesthesia induction\nWhen midazolam is administered intravenously (IV) for anesthetic induction, induction of anesthesia occurs in about 1.5 minutes when narcotic pre-medication has been given and in 2 to 2.5 minutes without narcotic pre-medication/ other sedative pre-medication. Impairment in a memory test was observed in 90% of the patients.14\n",

Samidorphan has been shown in animal models and clinical trials to ameliorate olanzapine-induced weight gain and metabolic dysfunction.5,6\nSamidorphan was first approved as a variety of fixed-dose combination tablets with olanzapine by the FDA on May 28, 2021, and is currently marketed under the trademark LYBALVI™ by Alkermes Inc.11\n",

As an opioid antagonist, it can potentiate opioid withdrawal in dependent patients; it should not be administered within seven days from the last use of short-acting opioids and at least 14 days after cessation of long-acting opioids. Similarly, samidorphan use may lead to life-threatening opioid overdose, either in patients who attempt to overcome the samidorphan-induced opioid blockade or resume opioid use when therapy is interrupted or discontinued.11\nSeveral other effects may be noted in combination with olanzapine, including increased risk for potentially fatal cerebrovascular events in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, hyperprolactinemia, and tardive dyskinesia. Olanzapine is associated with an increased risk of metabolic dysfunction, including hyperglycemia, type II diabetes, dyslipidemia, and weight gain. Patients may be at increased risk for orthostatic hypotension and syncope, particularly in patients with known cardiovascular/cerebrovascular disease. Leukopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis may occur and should be monitored for; patients with a history of seizure should also be monitored. This combination may exhibit anticholinergic (antimuscarinic) effects. It should be used with caution with other anticholinergic drugs and in patients with urinary retention, prostatic hypertrophy, constipation, paralytic ileus, or related conditions. Serious allergic reactions such as Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) have been reported. Patients may be at increased risk of cognitive and motor impairment; caution while operating machinery is recommended.11\n",

Moricizine has potent local anesthetic activity and membrane stabilizing effect. Decreases excitability, conduction velocity, and automaticity as a result of slowed atrioventricular (AV) nodal and His-Purkinje conduction. Decreases the action potential duration (APD) in Purkinje fibers; also decreases the effective refractory period (ERP) but to a lesser extent than the APD, so the ERP/APD ratio is increased. Decreases the maxiumum rate of Phase 0 depolarization (V max ), but does not affect action potential amplitude or maximum diastolic potential. Does not affect atrial, AV nodal, or left ventricular refractory periods and has minimal effect on ventricular repolarization (evidenced by the overall decrease in JT interval). Has no effect on sinoatrial (SA) nodal or intra-atrial conduction and only minimal effect on sinus cycle length and sinus node recovery time. In the Vaughan Williams classification of antiarrhythmics, moricizine is considered to be a class I agent. It has properties of class IA, IB, and IC agents but does not clearly belong to any of the three subclasses. It has less effect on the slope of phase 0 and a greater effect on action potential duration and effective refractory period than class IC agents.\n",

Amitraz presents insect repellent effects and hence, it can be used as an insecticide and pesticide. Its insecticide effect is due to its agonistic activity in the alpha-adrenergic system, its interaction with the octopamine receptors in the central nervous system and its driven inhibition of the synthesis of monoamine oxidases and prostaglandins. All the abovementioned effects are translated into the overexcitation, paralysis, and death in insects. \nAmitraz presents a lower effect in mammals and thus, it is widely used in the treatment of mite- or tick-infestation of dogs.\n",

It has a high electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, and reflectivity. Silver exists as a pure elemental form, alloy with other metals, and mineral. Having critical roles in various applications inducing chemical and industrial fields, silver compounds have also been used in the field of medicine for centuries due to their broad-spectrum biological actions. Silver nanoparticles especially have been widely used in industrial, household, and healthcare-related products due to their potent antimicrobial activity. Silver nitrate and Silver sulfadiazine have been used as topical antibacterial agents for the treatment of skin infections, while Silver sulfadiazine has also been valued for topical burn treatment 3. Silver and its compounds have been used in trials studying the management of dental caries since the 1800s, and they may be found in dental pastes as an active ingredients. However, some drawbacks of dental use of silver compounds include tooth discolouration and pulp irritation 3.\n",

Silver nanoparticles were also shown to mediate antibacterial activity against Gram-positive S. aureus and Gram-negative E. coli by inhibiting the growth 4. \nIn experimental dinitrochlorobenzene-induced inflammatory models in porcine or murine skin, topical application of silver nitrate and nanocrystalline silver were shown to exert anti-inflammatory effects associated with lymphocyte apoptosis, decreased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and reduced gelatinase activity 1. In a rat model of ulcerative colitis, orally or intracolonically administered nanocrystalline silver were shown to suppress matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-9), tumour necrosis factor (TNF), and interleukin-β (IL-β) and IL-12 1.\n",

Because ginsenosides appear to affect multiple pathways, their effects are complex and difficult to isolate. Rb1 appears to be most abundant in Panax quinquefolius (American Ginseng). Rb1 seems to affect the reproductive system in animal testicles. Recent research shows that Rb1 affects rat embryo development and has teratogenic effects, causing birth defects.

The bactericidal activity of Oxacillin results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis and is mediated through Oxacillin binding to penicillin binding proteins (PBPs). Oxacillin is stable against hydrolysis by a variety of beta-lactamases, including penicillinases, and cephalosporinases and extended spectrum beta-lactamases.\n",

        "cas": "52-86-8",
        "background": "Haloperidol is a high potency first-generation (typical) antipsychotic and one of the most frequently used antipsychotic medications used worldwide.7 While haloperidol has demonstrated pharmacologic activity at a number of receptors in the brain,10 it exerts its antipsychotic effect through its strong antagonism of the dopamine receptor (mainly D2), particularly within the mesolimbic and mesocortical systems of the brain. Haloperidol is indicated for the treatment of the manifestations of several psychotic disorders including schizophrenia, acute psychosis, Tourette syndrome, and other severe behavioural states.16 It is also used off-label for the management of chorea associated with Huntington's disease and for the treatment of intractable hiccups as it is a potent antiemetic. Dopamine-antagonizing medications such as haloperidol are though to improve psychotic symptoms and states that are caused by an over-production of dopamine, such as schizophrenia, which is theorized to be caused by a hyperdopaminergic state within the limbic system of the brain.9\nUse of the first-generation antipsychotics (including haloperidol) is considered highly effective for the management of the \"positive\" symptoms of schizophrenia including hallucinations, hearing voices, aggression/hostility, disorganized speech, and psychomotor agitation. However, this class of drugs is also limited by the development of movement disorders induced by dopamine-blockade such as drug-induced parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia, tardive dyskinesia, as well as other side effects including sedation, weight gain, and prolactin changes. While there are limited high-quality studies comparing haloperidol to lower-potency first-generation antipsychotics such as Chlorpromazine, Zuclopenthixol, Fluphenazine, and Methotrimeprazine, haloperidol typically demonstrates the least amount of side effects within this class, but demonstrates a stronger disposition for causing extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS).6,7,8 These other low‐potency antipsychotics are limited by their lower affinity for dopamine receptors, which requires a higher dose to effectively treat symptoms of schizophrenia. In addition, they block many receptors other than the primary target (dopamine receptors), such as cholinergic or histaminergic receptors, resulting in a higher incidence of side effects such as sedation, weight gain, and hypotension.\nInterestingly, in vivo pharmacogenetic studies have demonstrated that the metabolism of haloperidol may be modulated by genetically determined polymorphic CYP2D6 activity. However, these findings contradict the findings from studies in vitro with human liver microsomes and from drug interaction studies in vivo. Inter-ethnic and pharmacogenetic differences in haloperidol metabolism may possibly explain these observations.3\nFirst-generation antipsychotic drugs have largely been replaced with second- and third-generation (atypical) antipsychotics such as Risperidone, Olanzapine, Clozapine, Quetiapine, Aripiprazole, and Ziprasidone. However, haloperidol use remains widespread and is considered the benchmark for comparison in trials of the newer generation antipsychotics.8\nThe efficacy of haloperidol was first established in controlled trials in the 1960s.5\n",

Cortical dopamine-D2-pathways play an important role in regulating these effects and include the nigrostriatal pathway, which is responsible for causing extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), the mesolimbic and mesocortical pathways, which are responsible for the improvement in positive schizophrenic symptoms, and the tuberoinfundibular dopamine pathway, which is responsible for hyperprolactinemia. \nA syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements may develop in patients. Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely to develop the syndrome.16\nCases of sudden death, QT-prolongation, and Torsades de Pointes have been reported in patients receiving haloperidol. Higher than recommended doses of any formulation and intravenous administration of haloperidol appear to be associated with a higher risk of QT-prolongation and Torsades de Pointes. Although cases have been reported even in the absence of predisposing factors, particular caution is advised in treating patients with other QT-prolonging conditions (including electrolyte imbalance [particularly hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia], drugs known to prolong QT, underlying cardiac abnormalities, hypothyroidism, and familial long QT-syndrome).16\nA potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with antipsychotic drugs. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status (including catatonic signs) and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmias). Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis) and acute renal failure.16\n",

Oliceridine has the potential to cause severe respiratory depression, especially in patients who are elderly, cachectic, debilitated, or who otherwise have chronically impaired pulmonary function. In addition, severe respiratory depression or sedation may occur in patients with increased intracranial pressure, head injury, brain tumour, or impaired consciousness. Patients with adrenal insufficiency or severe hypotension may require treatment alterations or discontinuation. Finally, oliceridine has been demonstrated to prolong the QTc interval and has not been properly evaluated beyond a maximum daily dose of 27 mg; it is recommended not to exceed 27 mg per day.15\n",

It is reported to have a higher anti-inflammatory action or at least comparable effects than conventional NSAIDs in double-blind studies 2,3,5. Aceclofenac potently inhibits the cyclo-oxygenase enzyme (COX) that is involved in the synthesis of prostaglandins, which are inflammatory mediators that cause pain, swelling, inflammation, and fever. Aceclofenac belongs to BCS Class II as it possesses poor aqueous solubility 2. It displays high permeability to penetrate into synovial joints where in patients with osteoarthritis and related conditions, the loss of articular cartilage in the area causes joint pain, tenderness, stiffness, crepitus, and local inflammation 1. Aceclofenac is also reported to be effective in other painful conditions such as dental and gynaecological conditions 7. In 1991, aceclofenac was developed as an analog of a commonly prescribed NSAID, Diclofenac, via chemical modification in effort to improve the gastrointestinal tolerability of the drug. It is a more commonly prescribed drug in Europe.\n",

COX-1 enzyme is a constitutive enzyme involved in prostacyclin production and protective functions of gastric mucosa whereas COX-2 is an inducible enzyme involved in the production of inflammatory mediators in response to inflammatory stimuli. Aceclofenac displays more selectivity towards COX-2 (IC50 of 0.77uM) than COX-1 (IC50 of \u003e100uM), which promotes its gastric tolerance compared to other NSAIDs. The primary metabolite, 4'-hydroxyaceclofenac, also minimally inhibits COX-2 with IC50 value of 36uM 2. Although the mode of action of aceclofenac is thought to mainly arise from the inhibition of synthesis of prostaglandins (PGE2), aceclofenac also inhibits the production of inflammatory cytokines, interleukins (IL-1β, IL-6), and tumor necrosis factors (TNF) 1,2. It is also reported that aceclofenac also affects the cell adhesion molecules from neutrophils 8. Aceclofenac also targets the synthesis of glycosaminoglycan and mediates chrondroprotective effects 1. \n",

They stop tumor growth by cross-linking guanine bases in DNA double-helix strands - directly attacking DNA. This makes the strands unable to uncoil and separate. As this is necessary in DNA replication, the cells can no longer divide. In addition, these drugs add methyl or other alkyl groups onto molecules where they do not belong which in turn inhibits their correct utilization by base pairing and causes a miscoding of DNA. Procarbazine is cell-phase specific for the S phase of cell division.\n",
