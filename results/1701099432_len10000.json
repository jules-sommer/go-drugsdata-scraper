In healthy human volunteers, the mean plasma concentration of allantoin is about 2-3 mg/l. During exercise, the plasma allantoin concentration rapidly increases about two fold and remains elevated Label. In human muscle, urate is oxidized to allantoin during such exercise Label. The concentration of allantoin in muscles increases from a resting value of about 5000 ug/kg to about 16000 ug/kg immediately after short-term exhaustive cycling exercise Label. \nMore specifically, allantoin is a diureide of glyoxylic acid that is produced from uric acid. It is a major metabolic intermediate in most organisms. Allantoin is found in OTC cosmetic products and other commercial products such as oral hygiene products, in shampoos, lipsticks, anti-acne products, sun care products, and clarifying lotions 4. Allantoin has also demonstrated to ameliorate the wound healing process in some studies 1.\n",

It is structurally and pharmacologically related to other selective 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonist. Naratriptan has only a weak affinity for 5-HT1A, 5-HT5A, and 5-HT7 receptors and no significant affinity or pharmacological activity at 5-HT2, 5-HT3 or 5-HT4 receptor subtypes or at alpha1-, alpha2-, or beta-adrenergic, dopamine1,; dopamine2; muscarinic, or benzodiazepine receptors. This action in humans correlates with the relief of migraine headache. In addition to causing vasoconstriction, experimental data from animal studies show that Naratriptan also activates 5-HT1 receptors on peripheral terminals of the trigeminal nerve innervating cranial blood vessels, which may also contribute to the antimigrainous effect of Naratriptan in humans.\n",

First synthesized in 1897, bronopol was primarily used as a preservative for pharmaceuticals and was registered in the United States in 1984 for use in industrial bactericides, slimicides and preservatives 9. Bronopol is used as a microbicide or microbiostat in various commercial and industrial applications, including oil field systems, air washer systems, air conditioning or humidifying systems, cooling water systems, papermills, absorbent clays, metal working fluids, printing inks, paints, adhesives and consumer products 9. Compared to other aliphatic halogen-nitro compounds, bronopol is more stable to hydrolysis in aqueous media under normal conditions 3. The inhibitory activity against various bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, was demonstrated in vitro 3. The agent is largely available commercially as an antibacterial for a variety of industrial purposes while it is predominantly available for purchase as a pet animal litter antibacterial at the domestic consumer level 11. Nevertheless, ongoing contemporary re-evaluations of bronopol use in large markets such as Canada now place various compositional and product restrictions on the use of the agent in cosmetic products 7 and in other products where it may not primarily be used in the role of a non-medicinal preservative antimicrobial 8.\n",

In addition, preservative uses include household products (e.g., dishwashing liquids, laundry products), latex emulsions, polymer lattices, pigments, leather and milk samples for analysis 11.

The bactericidal activity is reported to be greater against Gram-negative bacteria than against Gram-positive cocci 3. Bronopol was also demonstrated to be effective against various fungal species, but the inhibitory action is reported to be minimal compared to that of against bacterial species 3. The inhibitory activity of bronopol decreases with increasing pH of the media 3,9. Bronopol also elicits an anti-protozoal activity, as demonstrated with Ichthyophthirius multifiliis in vitro and in vivo 2. It is proposed that bronopol affects the survival of all free-living stages of I. multifiliis 2. \n",

It allows for controlled release of drug substances, increasing duration of therapeutic effects 3. The physical characteristics of this drug resemble natural tears, providing lubrication to the ocular surface and maintaining corneal hydration in dry eye syndromes 7.\nHypromellose is considered an inert substance as it has no direct pharmacological activity. The viscosity promoting properties of hypromellose prolong the retention time and improve adhesion of synthetic tears to the cornea and conjunctiva. As a result, the tear film breakdown time is prolonged and/or the tear film stability is enhanced. A stable tear film protects the cornea from dryness and epithelial cells 6.\nHypromellose is a methyl and hydroxypropyl mixed ether of cellulose. It is utilized as artificial tears to prevent conjunctival and corneal damage due to impaired lacrimal secretions. It is also used as a visco-elastic promoting agent by maintaining a deep, viscous chamber and allowing for easier manipulation, helping the vitreous surface to be pushed back, thus preventing the formation of a postoperative flat chamber 5.\n",

Binimetinib also inhibited in vivo ERK phosphorylation and tumor growth in BRAF-mutant murine xenograft models.5 MEK is an enzyme that regulates the biosynthesis of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF, IL-6 and IL-1; therefore, binimetinib anti-tumor activity can be mediated through the interference of cytokines biosynthesis.1,3\nBinimetinib and encorafenib target two different kinases in the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway. Compared to either drug alone, coadministration of encorafenib and binimetinib resulted in greater anti-proliferative activity in vitro in BRAF mutation-positive cell lines and greater anti-tumor activity with respect to tumor growth inhibition in BRAF V600E mutant human melanoma xenograft studies in mice. Additionally, the combination of binimetinib and encorafenib delayed the emergence of resistance in BRAF V600E mutant human melanoma xenografts in mice compared to either drug alone. In a BRAF V600E mutant NSCLC patient-derived xenograft model in mice, coadministration of encorafenib and binimetinib resulted in greater anti-tumor activity compared to binimetinib alone, with respect to tumor growth inhibition. Increased tumor growth delay after dosing cessation was also observed with the coadministration compared to either drug alone.5\nFollowing MEKTOVI 45 mg twice daily, no clinically meaningful QT prolongation was observed.5\n",

It is postulated to exert its therapeutic effect by enhancing cholinergic function through the inhibition of the acetylcholine hydrolysis by acetylcholinesterase. Increased levels of acetylcholine has peripheral effects, as acetylcholine is also used in the brain, where it tends to cause excitatory actions. The glands that receive impulses from the parasympathetic part of the autonomic nervous system are also stimulated in the same way. This is why an increase in acetylcholine causes a decreased heart rate and increased production of saliva. Ambenonium is used less commonly than neostigmine or pyridostigmine but may be preferred in patients hypersensitive to the bromide ion. Ambenonium produces fewer muscarinic side effects than neostigmine, but more than pyridostigmine.\n",

        "pharmacodynamics": "Lipoic acid (or α-lipoic acid) is able to pass the blood-brain barrier and is putatively used for detoxification of mercury attached to the brain cells. It can mobilise bound mercury into the blood stream as it is a mercaptan (sulfur compound which readily binds to the mercury). In the blood stream, another chelator such as dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) or methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) is used to transfer mercury safely into the urine for excretion. Neither DMSA nor MSM can cross the blood-brain barrier, which is why both lipoic acid and DMSA are used. It is hypothesized that this treatment-along with carnitine, dimethylglycine (DMG), Vitamin B6, folic acid, and magnesium—could be used to treat autism and amalgam poisoning. In this hypothesis, the reason why autism is difficult to treat is that mercury is attached to the brain cells and most medicines and vitamin supplements do not penetrate the blood-brain barrier. However, α-lipoic acid and perhaps vitamin B12 could making it possible for other chelators to remove mercury safely out of the body and could perhaps one day be used as a treatment for autism. Because lipoic acid is related to cellular uptake of glucose and it is both soluble in water and fat, it is being used for treatment in diabetes. It may be helpful for people with Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease.\n",

Secondary hyperparathyroidism (HPT) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a progressive disease, associated with increases in parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels and derangements in calcium and phosphorus metabolism. Increased PTH stimulates osteoclastic activity resulting in cortical bone resorption and marrow fibrosis. The goals of treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism are to lower levels of PTH, calcium, and phosphorus in the blood, in order to prevent progressive bone disease and the systemic consequences of disordered mineral metabolism. In CKD patients on dialysis with uncontrolled secondary HPT, reductions in PTH are associated with a favorable impact on bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BALP), bone turnover and bone fibrosis. Cinacalcet reduces calcium levels by increasing the sensitivity of the calcium sensing receptor to extracellular calcium.\n",

For instance, naproxen can adversely affect blood pressure control.10 A study found that use of naproxen induced an increase in blood pressure, although the increase was not as significant as that found with ibuprofen use.10\nFurther, studies have found that the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding is on average four-fold higher for individuals taking NSAIDs.11 Other factors that increase the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding include concurrent use of corticosteroids or anticoagulants, and a history of gastrointestinal ulcers.11\n",

The inhibition of serum thromboxane B2 (TXB2) levels was higher than 85%. Hence, morniflumate is demonstrated to reduce arachidonic acid metabolism, by exerting its effects on cyclooxygenase and 5-lipoxygenase. This characteristic might provide a better approach for anti-inflammatory therapy 1.\nIn several animal models orally administered morniflumate, the beta-morpholinoethyl ester of niflumic acid, proved almost equal to the parent compound in anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic activity with the absence of gastric irritating/ulcerogenic effects of its acidic parent compound 7.\n",

This may influence several physiological functions including, but not restricted to, lowering both pre- and afterload of the heart and downregulation of sympathetic activity, and decreased intraglomerular pressure which is believed to be mediated by increased tubuloglomerular feedback.10\nIncreases in the amount of glucose excreted in the urine were observed in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus following the administration of dapagliflozin. Dapagliflozin doses of 5 or 10 mg per day in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus for 12 weeks resulted in excretion of approximately 70 grams of glucose in the urine per day at Week 12. A near-maximum glucose excretion was observed at the dapagliflozin daily dose of 20 mg. This urinary glucose excretion with dapagliflozin also results in increases in urinary volume. After discontinuation of dapagliflozin, on average, the elevation in urinary glucose excretion approaches baseline by about 3 days for the 10 mg dose.10\nDapagliflozin was not associated with clinically meaningful prolongation of QTc interval at daily doses up to 150 mg (15 times the recommended maximum dose) in a study of healthy subjects. In addition, no clinically meaningful effect on QTc interval was observed following single doses of up to 500 mg (50 times the recommended maximum dose) of dapagliflozin in healthy subjects.10\n",

Several analogues were later developed, some of which—such as pioglitazone and troglitazone—made it to the market.\nCiglitazone significantly decreases VEGF production by human granulosa cells in an in vitro study, and may potentially be used in ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. Ciglitazone is a potent and selective PPARγ ligand with an EC50 of 3.0 µM. It is also an anti-hyperglycemic agent in the ob/ob murine model in vivo. Ciglitazone increases adipogenesis, decreases differentiation and angiogenesis in human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC), and osteoblastogenesis in human mesenchymal stem cells.\n",

Increases in the TT and aPTT were 1.8 times those of the control group.11 Enoxaparin at 1 mg/kg subcutaneously every 12 hours led to aPTT values of 45 seconds or less in most patients. Average aPTT prolongation time on Day 1 was approximately 16% higher than on Day 4 of enoxaparin therapy.11\nCaution is advised during treatment with enoxaparin - the risk of hemorrhage and thrombocytopenia is increased.

Ciclopirox exhibits either fungistatic or fungicidal activity in vitro against a broad spectrum of fungal organisms, such as dermatophytes, yeasts, dimorphic fungi, eumycetes, and actinomycetes. In addition to its broad spectrum of action, ciclopirox also exerts antibacterial activity against many Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Furthermore, the anti-inflammatory effects of ciclopirox have been demonstrated in human polymorphonuclear cells, where ciclopirox has inhibited the synthesis of prostaglandin and leukotriene. Ciclopirox can also exhibit its anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting the formation of 5-lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase.\n",

Danaparoid possesses a potent antithrombic activity that works by inhibiting activated factor X (Factor Xa) and activated factor II (Factor IIa). It is chemically distinct from heparin by containing different protein binding properties, thus has lower cross-reactivity in heparin-intolerant patients. Danaproid is used in the treatment of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) as an off-label indication and prevention of post-operative deep venous thrombosis (DVT). While it was initially approved by the FDA as Orgaran™, danaparoid was withdrawn by Organon International on August 14, 2002, due to a shortage in drug substance by the manufacturer. The use of Orgaran™ was discontinued in the United States however it is available in several other countries including European countries and Japan.

Danaparoid is as an antithrombotic agent that prevents the formation of fibrin in the coagulation pathway. It has a high antifactor Xa to antifactor IIa (thrombin) activity that primarily works via antithrombin III-mediated inhibition of factor Xa 3. The ratio of antifactor Xa to antifactor II activity is ≥ 20:1 3. Danaparoid has a minor effect on platelet function and aggregation Label. In a worldwide compassionate-use programme involving a total of 667 patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), treatment with danaparoid resulted in 93% of successful outcomes in resolving HIT 3. \nIn healthy volunteers, danaparoid caused significantly less prolongation o f the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and was associated with a significantly lower thrombin time than unfractionated heparin (UFH) and low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) 3. Danaparoid displays lower lipolytic activity than UFH in vitro and in healthy individuals, leading to lower plasma levels of free fatty acids 3. Danaparoid has been associated with the cross-reactivity with pathogenic heparin-induced platelet-factor 4 (PF4) antibodies, which occurs in about 10 % or more by in vitro testing 1. The clinical relevance of this effect is not fully understood 1. \n",

        "pharmacodynamics": "Aminohippurate (p-aminohippuric acid, PAH, PAHA) is the glycine amide of p-aminobenzoic acid. It is filtered by the glomeruli and is actively secreted by the proximal tubules. At low plasma concentrations (1.0 to 2.0 mg/100 mL), an average of 90 percent of aminohippurate is cleared by the kidneys from the renal blood stream in a single circulation. It is ideally suited for measurement of ERPF since it has a high clearance, is essentially nontoxic at the plasma concentrations reached with recommended doses, and its analytical determination is relatively simple and accurate. Aminohippurate is also used to measure the functional capacity of the renal tubular secretory mechanism or transport maximum (TmPAH). This is accomplished by elevating the plasma concentration to levels (40-60 mg/100 mL) sufficient to saturate the maximal capacity of the tubular cells to secrete aminohippurate. Inulin clearance is generally measured during TmPAH determinations since glomerular filtration rate (GFR) must be known before calculations of secretory Tm measurements can be done.\n"

It has been proposed that by interacting with the ETC, idebenone increases ATP production required for mitochondrial function, reduces free radicals, inhibits lipid peroxidation, and consequently protects the lipid membrane and mitochondria from oxidative damage 2. More specifically, idebenone is thought to transfer electrons directly to complex III of the mitochondrial ETC, thereby circumventing complex I and restoring cellular energy (ATP) generation 4. \nDue to its ability to reduce oxidative damage and improve ATP production, idebenone was originally investigated for its potential use in Alzheimer's Disease and other cognitivie disorders 3. Lack of improvement in cognitive function halted its production for these conditions, however it continues to be investigated for use in other conditions associated with mitochondrial damage. \nIdebenone is currently only indicated for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of visual impairment in adolescent and adult patients with\nLeber’s Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON). LHON is a mitochondrially inherited degeneration of retinal ganglion cells, resulting in acute central vision loss. Due to its biochemical mode of action, it's thought that idebenone may re-activate viable-but-inactive retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in LHON patients 4. It is not currently approved for use by either the Food and Drug Administration (USA) or Health Canada.\n",

Fucoxanthin isis a marine carotenoid mainly found in brown algae, giving them a brown or olive-green color. Fucoxanthin is investigated for its anti-inflammatory, antinociceptive and anti-cancer effects. In vivo studies have demonstrated that oral administration of fucoxanthin inhibited carcinogenesis in an animal model of duodenal, skin, colon and liver cancer. Fucoxanthin causes antitumor and anticarcinogenic effects by inducing G1 cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis by modulating expression of various cellular molecules and cellular signal transduction pathways, but the exact mechanism of anti-cancer action of fucoxanthin is not fully elucidated. Fucoxanthin regulates lipids metabolism, the effect most likely mediated by AMK-activated protein kinase. A clinical trial of fucoxanthin against non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is ongoing.\n",

Used in the treatment of hypertension, enalapril is an ACE inhibitor that prevents Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) from transforming angiotensin I into angiotensin II. As angiotensin II is responsible for vasoconstriction and sodium reabsorption in the proximal tubule of the kidney, down-regulation of this protein results in reduced blood pressure and blood fluid volume. Enalaprilat was originally created to overcome the limitations of the first ACE inhibitor, captopril, which had numerous side effects and left a metallic taste in the mouth. Removal of the problematic thiol group from captopril resulted in enalaprilat, which was then modified further with an ester to create the orally available pro-drug enalapril.\nEnalaprilat is poorly orally available and is therefore only available as an intravenous injection for the treatment of hypertension when oral therapy is not possible.\n",

The onset of action usually occurs within fifteen minutes of administration with the maximum effect occurring within one to four hours. The abrupt withdrawal of enalaprilat has not been associated with a rapid increase in blood pressure.\nThe duration of hemodynamic effects appears to be dose-related. However, for the recommended dose, the duration of action in most patients is approximately six hours.\nFollowing administration of enalapril, there is an increase in renal blood flow; glomerular filtration rate is usually unchanged.

        "pharmacodynamics": "Alverine is a smooth muscle relaxant. Smooth muscle is a type of muscle that is not under voluntary control; it is the muscle present in places such as the gut and uterus. Alverine acts directly on the muscle in the gut, causing it to relax. This prevents the muscle spasms which occur in the gut in conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome and diverticular disease. Diverticular disease is a condition in which small pouches form in the gut lining. These pouches can trap particles of food and become inflamed and painful. In irritable bowel syndrome the normal activity of the gut muscle is lost. The muscle spasms result in symptoms such as heartburn, abdominal pain and bloating, constipation or diarrhoea. By relaxing the gut muscle, alverine citrate relieves the symptoms of this condition. Alverine also relaxes the smooth muscle in the womb (uterus). It is therefore also used to treat painful menstruation, which is caused by muscle spasms in the uterus (dysmenorrhea).\n",

Aspartic acid and phenylalanine are also found naturally in protein containing foods, including meats, grains and dairy products. Methyl esters are also found naturally in many foods such as fruits and vegetable and their juices. Upon digestion, aspartame breaks down into three components (aspartic acid, phenylalanine and methanol), which are then absorbed into the blood and used in normal body processes. Neither aspartame nor its components accumulates in the body. These components are used in the body in the same ways as when they are derived from common foods.\n",

Ammonia gas has been used in the clinical setting as a respiratory stimulant to prevent fainting. The radiolabelled form of ammonia, ammonia N 13, is intravenously administered as a radioactive diagnostic agent for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging of the myocardium to evaluate myocardial perfusion. Ammonia is a natural byproduct of biological and chemical reactions, including decomposition of organic matter, including plants, animals, and animal wastes. It is present in normally present in all tissues constituting a metabolic pool, where it is mostly taken up by glutamic acid and take part in transamination and other reactions, including the synthesis of protein by the Krebs-Hanseleit cycle in the liver 5.

It was approved by the Food and Drug Administration on January 31, 201213, and by Health Canada in late 2012.15 Ivacaftor is administered as a monotherapy and also administered in combination with other drugs for the management of CF.14,18,16\nCystic Fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by one of several different mutations in the gene for the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) protein, an ion channel involved in the transport of chloride and sodium ions across cell membranes. CFTR is active in epithelial cells of organs such as of the lungs, pancreas, liver, digestive system, and reproductive tract. Alterations in the CFTR gene result in altered production, misfolding, or function of the protein and consequently abnormal fluid and ion transport across cell membranes.5,6 As a result, CF patients produce thick, sticky mucus that clogs the ducts of organs where it is produced making patients more susceptible to complications such as infections, lung damage, pancreatic insufficiency, and malnutrition.8\nPrior to the development of ivacaftor, management of CF primarily involved therapies for the control of infections, nutritional support, clearance of mucus, and management of symptoms rather than improvements in the underlying disease process or lung function (FEV1). Notably, ivacaftor was the first medication approved for the management of the underlying causes of CF (abnormalities in CFTR protein function) rather than control of symptoms.4\n",

If the patient’s genotype is unknown, an FDA-cleared CF mutation test should be used to detect the presence of the F508del mutation on both alleles of the CFTR gene.20\nWhen used in combination with tezacaftor in the product Symdeko, it is used to manage CF in patients 12 years and older who have at least one mutation in the CFTR gene or patients aged 12 or older who are shown to be homozygous for the F508del mutation.14\nWhen used in combination with tezacaftor and elexacaftor in the product Trikafta, it is indicated for the treatment of cystic fibrosis in patients 12 years of age and older who have at least one F508del mutation in the CFTR gene.17\nReduce drug development failure ratesBuild, train, \u0026 validate machine-learning modelswith evidence-based and structured datasets.See how  Build, train, \u0026 validate predictive machine-learning models with structured datasets.See how",
        "pharmacodynamics": "The use of Ivacaftor has been shown to both improve CF symptoms and modulate underlying disease pathology. This is achieved by potentiating the channel opening probability (or gating) of CFTR protein in patients with impaired gating mechanisms. This is in contrast to Lumacaftor, another CF medication, that functions by preventing misfolding of the CFTR protein and thereby results in increased processing and trafficking of mature protein to the cell surface. \nResults from clinical trials indicated that treatment with ivacaftor results in improved lung function, reduced chance of experiencing a pulmonary exacerbation, reduced sweat chloride, increased weight gain, and improvements in CF symptoms and quality of life.18 When combined with tezacaftor, significant improvements in lung function have been observed in clinical studies.14 Ivacaftor was not found to increase the QTc interval in a clinically significant manner.18\nAlthough ivacaftor given alone has not shown any significant improvements in patients with the delta-F508 mutation, it has shown significant improvements (\u003e10% increase in FEV1 from baseline) in lung function for the following mutations: E56K, P67L, R74W, D110E, D110H, R117C, R117H, G178R, E193K, L206W, R347H, R352Q, A455E, S549N, S549R, G551D, G551S, D579G, S945L, S977F, F1052V, K1060T, A1067T, G1069R, R1070Q, R1070W, F1074L, D1152H, G1244E, S1251N, S1255P, D1270N, and G1349.18 This list was expanded by the FDA in May 2017 from 10 to 33 to accommodate more rare mutations.13\nIt is important to note that this drug may cause an increase in liver transaminases (ALT, AST).

Aminoglycosides work by binding to the bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit, causing misreading of t-RNA, leaving the bacterium unable to synthesize proteins vital to its growth. Aminoglycosides are useful primarily in infections involving aerobic, Gram-negative bacteria, such as Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, and Enterobacter. In addition, some mycobacteria, including the bacteria that cause tuberculosis, are susceptible to aminoglycosides. Infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria can also be treated with aminoglycosides, but other types of antibiotics are more potent and less damaging to the host. In the past the aminoglycosides have been used in conjunction with penicillin-related antibiotics in streptococcal infections for their synergistic effects, particularly in endocarditis. Aminoglycosides are mostly ineffective against anaerobic bacteria, fungi and viruses.\n",

        "pharmacodynamics": "Carboprost tromethamine administered intramuscularly stimulates in the gravid uterus myometrial contractions similar to labor contractions at the end of a full term pregnancy. Whether or not these contractions result from a direct effect of carboprost on the myome-trium has not been determined. Nonetheless, they evacuate the products of conception from the uterus in most cases. Postpartum, the resultant myometrial contractions provide hemostasis at the site of placentation. Carboprost tromethamine also stimulates the smooth muscle of the human gastrointestinal tract. This activity may produce the vomiting or diarrhea or both that is common when carbo-prost tromethamine is used to terminate pregnancy and for use postpartum. In laboratory animals and also in humans carboprost tromethamine can elevate body temperature. With the clinical doses of carboprost trometh-amine used for the termination of pregnancy, and for use postpartum, some patients do experience transient temperature increases. In laboratory animals and in humans large doses of carboprost tromethamine can raise blood pressure, probably by contracting the vascular smooth muscle. With the doses of carboprost tromethamine used for terminating pregnancy, this effect has not been clinically significant. In laboratory animals and also in humans carboprost tromethamine can elevate body temperature. With the clinical doses of carboprost tromethamine used for the termination of pregnancy, some patients do experience temperature increases. In some patients, carboprost tromethamine may cause transient bronchoconstriction.\n",

Icotinib selectively solely inhibits the EGFR members including the wild type and mutants with inhibition efficacies of 61-99%. Icotinib blocks EGFR-mediated intracellular tyrosine phosphorylation in human epidermoid carcinoma A431 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Meanwhile, in the proliferation assay performed on A431, BGC-823, A549, H460, HCT8, KB and Bel-7402 cell lines, it was found that the relative sensitivity of cell lines to Icotinib is A431 \u003e BGC-823 \u003e A549 \u003e H460 \u003e KB \u003e HCT8 and Bel-7402. Icotinib exhibits a broad spectrum of antitumor activity and it is especially effective against tumors expressing higher levels of EGFR.\nIn vivo: In vivo studies demonstrated that Icotinib exhibited potent dose-dependent antitumor effects in nude mice carrying a variety of human tumor-derived xenografts. The drug was well tolerated at doses up to 120 mg/kg/day in mice without mortality or significant body weight loss during the treatment. A head to head randomized, double blind phase III trial using Gefitinib as an active control for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was finished recently (Trial registration ID: NCT01040780).\n",

The decrease in intracellular calcium inhibits the contractile processes of the myocardial smooth muscle cells, causing dilation of the coronary and systemic arteries, increased oxygen delivery to the myocardial tissue, decreased total peripheral resistance, decreased systemic blood pressure, and decreased afterload.\n",

Calcium ions entering the cell through these channels bind to calmodulin. Calcium-bound calmodulin then binds to and activates myosin light chain kinase (MLCK). Activated MLCK catalyzes the phosphorylation of the regulatory light chain subunit of myosin, a key step in muscle contraction. Signal amplification is achieved by calcium-induced calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum through ryanodine receptors. Inhibition of the initial influx of calcium decreases the contractile activity of arterial smooth muscle cells and results in vasodilation. The vasodilatory effects of isradipine result in an overall decrease in blood pressure. \n",

        "pharmacodynamics": "Brompheniramine is an antihistaminergic medication of the propylamine class. It is a first-generation antihistamine. In allergic reactions an allergen interacts with and cross-links surface IgE antibodies on mast cells and basophils. Once the mast cell-antibody-antigen complex is formed, a complex series of events occurs that eventually leads to cell-degranulation and the release of histamine (and other chemical mediators) from the mast cell or basophil. Once released, histamine can react with local or widespread tissues through histamine receptors. Histamine, acting on H1-receptors, produces pruritis, vasodilatation, hypotension, flushing, headache, tachycardia, and bronchoconstriction. Histamine also increases vascular permeability and potentiates pain. Brompheniramine is a histamine H1 antagonist (or more correctly, an inverse histamine agonist) of the alkylamine class. It provides effective, temporary relief of sneezing, watery and itchy eyes, and runny nose due to hay fever and other upper respiratory allergies.\n",

It was initially approved by the FDA in 1991 4.\nIt is primarily used for the treatment of respiratory, enteric and genitourinary infections and may be used instead of other macrolides for some sexually transmitted and enteric infections. It is structurally related to erythromycin 2.\nAzithromycin [9-deoxo-9a-aza-9a-methyl-9a-homoerythromycin] is a part of the azalide subclass of macrolides, and contains a 15-membered ring, with a methyl-substituted nitrogen instead of a carbonyl group at the 9a position on the aglycone ring, which allows for the prevention of its metabolism. This differentiates azithromycin from other types of macrolides 4.\nIn March 2020, a small study was funded by the French government to investigate the treatment of COVID-19 with a combination of azithromycin and the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine. The results were positive, all patients taking the combination were virologically cured within 6 days of treatment, however, larger studies are required.9\n",

This is likely due to the fact that it elicits a gradual fall in blood pressure\nIt also exhibits a prolonged hypotensive effect and has been shown to have a strong anti-arteriosclerotic action in vessels due to its high affinity for vascular tissue and antioxidative activity 2. \nClinical studies have demonstrated that azelnidipine markedly reduced heart rate and proteinuria in hypertensive patients by inhibiting sympathetic nerve activity. Azelnidipine has also been confirmed to have cardio-protective, neuroprotective, and anti-atherosclerotic properties, and has also been found to prevent insulin resistance 2.\n",

This enzyme converts lanosterol to ergosterol, and is required in fungal cell wall synthesis. The subsequent loss of normal sterols correlates with the accumulation of 14 α-methyl sterols in fungi and may be partly responsible for the fungistatic activity of fluconazole. Mammalian cell demethylation is much less sensitive to fluconazole inhibition. Itraconazole exhibits in vitro activity against Cryptococcus neoformans and Candida spp. Fungistatic activity has also been demonstrated in normal and immunocompromised animal models for systemic and intracranial fungal infections due to Cryptococcus neoformans and for systemic infections due to Candida albicans.\n",

Beclomethasone dipropionate itself posesses weak glucocorticoid receptor binding affinity and is rapidly converted into 17-BMP upon administration.1 Formulations for oral inhalation, intranasal, and topical use are available for beclomethasone dipropionate. Beclomethasone dipropionate became first available in a pressurized metered-dose inhaler in 1972 and later in a dry powder inhaler and an aqueous nasal spray.1 Due to its anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and anti-allergy properties, beclomethasone dipropionate is used in various inflammatory conditions, such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, and dermatoses to reduce symptoms. When inhaled, it is proposed that beclomethasone dipropionate remains active locally in the lung without causing significant side effects associated with systemic corticosteroids.8 Compared to earlier corticosteroids such as dexamethasone and prednisolone, beclomethasone dipropionate is reported to be less irritating to the nasal mucosa with a longer duration of action when administered intranasally.3\n",

Inflammation is a primary defense mechanism and the homeostatic response of the immune system; however, a prolonged inflammatory response in certain disorders may lead to tissue damage, pain, and swelling. Beclomethasone dipropionate works by attenuating the inflammatory responses associated with asthma, allergic rhinitis, nasal polyps, and corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses. It suppresses the actions of inflammatory cells, such as mast cells, eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils. It also inhibits the release of inflammatory mediators, such as histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, and cytokines.11 Beclomethasone dipropionate is reported to exhibit potent topical activity while possessing low systemic effects.2 \nBeclomethasone dipropionate is a corticosteroid drug with anti-inflammatory and vasoconstrictive effects used to treat chronic inflammatory processes such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses. When inhaled, it improves lung function, decreases airway hyper-reactivity, and reduces the severity of asthmatic symptoms.9 Although inhaled corticosteroids, including beclomethasone dipropionate, are reported to mainly act locally in the lungs, systemic effects such as disruption of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function, bone turnover, osteoporosis, and growth suppression may still be observed with chronic use or high dose administration. There were varying findings from clinical studies examining the effect of beclomethasone dipropionate on growth suppression in pediatric patients.9 It was shown to suppress the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in a dose-dependent manner.6 HPA axis is a central hormonal response system to stress and activation of HPA axis leads to the production of endogenous steroid hormone production.7 Long-term use of high-dose systemic corticosteroids, including those inhaled, was often associated with signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency when exposed to stress conditions, such as trauma, surgery, or infections. As corticosteroids work by suppressing the immune system, there may be an increased risk for developing infections.11 Cases of Candida albicans infection of the mouth and throat have been reported with inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate therapy.8\n",

Fenoprofen inhibits prostaglandin synthesis by decreasing the enzyme needed for biosynthesis. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, the anti-inflammatory action of fenoprofen has been evidenced by relief of pain, increase in grip strength, and reductions in joint swelling, duration of morning stiffness, and disease activity (as assessed by both the investigator and the patient). In patients with osteoarthritis, the anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects of fenoprofen have been demonstrated by reduction in tenderness as a response to pressure and reductions in night pain, stiffness, swelling, and overall disease activity (as assessed by both the patient and the investigator). These effects have also been demonstrated by relief of pain with motion and at rest and increased range of motion in involved joints. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, clinical studies have shown fenoprofen to be comparable to aspirin in controlling the aforementioned measures of disease activity, but mild gastrointestinal reactions (nausea, dyspepsia) and tinnitus occurred less frequently in patients treated with fenoprofen than in aspirin-treated patients. It is not known whether fenoprofen causes less peptic ulceration than does aspirin. In patients with pain, the analgesic action of fenoprofen has produced a reduction in pain intensity, an increase in pain relief, improvement in total analgesia scores, and a sustained analgesic effect.\n",

        "background": "Enalapril is a prodrug belonging to the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor drug class that works on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which is responsible for the regulation of blood pressure and fluid and electrolyte homeostasis. Enalapril is an orally-active and long-acting nonsulphydryl antihypertensive agent that suppresses the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system to lower blood pressure. It was developed from a targeted research programmed using molecular modelling.2 Being a prodrug, enalapril is rapidly biotransformed into its active metabolite, enalaprilat, which is responsible for the pharmacological actions of enalapril. The active metabolite of enalapril competitively inhibits the ACE to hinder the production of angiotensin II, a key component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system that promotes vasoconstriction and renal reabsorption of sodium ions in the kidneys. Ultimately, enalaprilat works to reduce blood pressure and blood fluid volume.\nCommonly marketed under the trade name Vasotec, enalapril was first approved by the FDA in 1985 for the management of hypertension, heart failure, and asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction. It is also found in a combination product containing hydrochlorothiazide that is used for the management of hypertension. The active metabolite enalaprilat is also available in oral tablets and intravenous formulations for injection.\n",

Enalapril lowers blood pressure in all grades of essential and renovascular hypertension, and peripheral vascular resistance without causing an increase in heart rate.6 Individuals with low-renin hypertensive population were still responsive to enalapril.Label The duration of hypertensive effect in the systolic and diastolic blood pressure persists for at least 24 hours following initial administration of a single oral dose, and repeated daily administration of enalapril confers an additional reduction in blood pressure and a steady-state antihypertensive response may take several weeks.7 In patients with severe congestive heart failure and inadequate clinical response to conventional antihypertensive therapies, treatment with enalapril resulted in improvements in cardiac performance as observed by a reduction in both preload and afterload, and improved clinical status long-term.6 Furthermore, enalapril was shown to increase cardiac output and stroke volume while decreasing pulmonary capillary wedge pressure in patients with congestive heart failure refractory to conventional treatment with digitalis and diuretics. In clinical studies, enalapril reduced left ventricular mass, and did not affect cardiac function or myocardial perfusion during exercise.5 Enalapril is not highly associated with the risk of bradycardia unlike most diuretics and beta-blockers 6 and it does not produce rebound hypertension upon discontinuation of therapy.5 \nEnalapril is not reported to produce hypokalaemia, hyperglycaemia, hyperuricaemia or hypercholesterolaemia. In the kidneys, enalapril was shown to increase renal blood flow and decrease renal vascular resistance. It also augmented the glomerular filtration rate in patients with a glomerular filtration rate less than 80 mL/min.5 When used in combination, enalapril was shown to attenuate the extent of drug-induced hypokalemia caused by hydrochlorothiazide 6 and the antihypertensive effects of both drugs were potentiated.2\n",

        "pharmacodynamics": "Hydrocortisone is the most important human glucocorticoid. It is essential for life and regulates or supports a variety of important cardiovascular, metabolic, immunologic and homeostatic functions. Topical hydrocortisone is used for its anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive properties to treat inflammation due to corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses. Glucocorticoids are a class of steroid hormones characterised by an ability to bind with the cortisol receptor and trigger a variety of important cardiovascular, metabolic, immunologic and homeostatic effects. Glucocorticoids are distinguished from mineralocorticoids and sex steroids by having different receptors, target cells, and effects. Technically, the term corticosteroid refers to both glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids, but is often used as a synonym for glucocorticoid. Glucocorticoids suppress cell-mediated immunity. They act by inhibiting genes that code for the cytokines IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-alpha, the most important of which is the IL-2. Reduced cytokine production limits T cell proliferation. Glucocorticoids also suppress humoral immunity, causing B cells to express lower amounts of IL-2 and IL-2 receptors. This diminishes both B cell clonal expansion and antibody synthesis. The diminished amounts of IL-2 also leads to fewer T lymphocyte cells being activated.\n",

Thiazides also cause loss of potassium and an increase in serum uric acid. Thiazides are often used to treat hypertension, but their hypotensive effects are not necessarily due to their diuretic activity. Thiazides have been shown to prevent hypertension-related morbidity and mortality although the mechanism is not fully understood. Thiazides cause vasodilation by activating calcium-activated potassium channels (large conductance) in vascular smooth muscles and inhibiting various carbonic anhydrases in vascular tissue. Chlorothiazide affects the distal renal tubular mechanism of electrolyte reabsorption. At maximal therapeutic dosages, all thiazides are approximately equal in their diuretic efficacy. Chlorothiazide increases excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Natriuresis may be accompanied by some loss of potassium and bicarbonate. After oral doses, 10-15 percent of the dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. Chlorothiazide crosses the placental but not the blood-brain barrier and is excreted in breast milk.\n",

It is listed as an illicit substance in many countries due to addiction issues and listed as a prohibited substance by the World Anti-Doping Agency. Structurally, fenproporex (N-2-cyanoethylamphetamine) falls within the phenylethamine and amphetamine chemical class of drugs. The N-2-cyanoethyl substituent was once believed to be resistant to cleavage, because fenproporex -- once recommended as an obesity treatment for patients with cardiovascular disease -- was originally claimed to lack stimulant properties. Contrary to the claim, research has demonstrated easy in vivo cleavage of the N-2-cyanothyl substituent to yield amphetamine as a metabolite. [5] However, in clinical practice, central nervous system stimulative effects are less notorious than with some other agents such as diethylpropion and mazindol. [7]\nIn the United States fenproporex was never approved by the FDA for clinical use due to a lack of efficacy and safety data, and is listed as a drug in Schedule IV of the Controlled Substances Act. In 2006 and 2009, the FDA issued warnings that it had been detected in diet pills sold online, and imported from foreign manufacturers.\nDespite being banned in the United States, fenproporex has been described as the second most commonly consumed appetite suppressant worldwide, [6] with fenproporex containing anorectics still being commonly prescribed in South America. Little is known about the specific hazards of amphetamine based diet pills, however case reports have noted side effects such as chest pain, palpitations, headaches, and insomnia. In addition, placebo controlled studies have shown that participants using fenproporex experience more joint pain, sweating, blurred vision and tremor. [2]\n",

        "pharmacodynamics": "Cefepime is a fourth-generation cephalosporin antibiotic.5,6 It is active against Gram-negative bacteria such as Enterobacter spp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Viridans group streptococci.5,6 Compared to third-generation cephalosporins, cefepime has an extended Gram-negative coverage. Whereas other cephalosporins are degraded by plasmid- and chromosome-mediated beta-lactamases, cefepime is stable and not significantly hydrolyzed by these enzymes.1,4 Cefepime is also a poor inducer of type 1 beta-lactamases and, therefore, a good alternative against bacteria resistant to third-generation cephalosporins.1 \nIn animal models of infection, the time that the unbound plasma concentration of cefepime exceeds the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of infecting organisms has been shown to correlate with treatment efficacy.5,6 It has been suggested that cefepime can cross the inflamed blood-brain barrier.5,6 This, along with its ability to inhibit γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), could lead to the neurotoxic effects observed in some of the patients treated with cefepime.3,4\n",

When the implant was removed, normal periods were reinstalled within 90 days in 91% of the individuals. Fertility was established quickly with 20 reported pregnancies within 3 months of implant removal.7\nThe implants of etonogestrel release 40 mcg of etonogestrel daily and they usually provide a continuous contraception effect for 3 years.

        "pharmacodynamics": "In allergic reactions an allergen interacts with and cross-links surface IgE antibodies on mast cells and basophils. Once the mast cell-antibody-antigen complex is formed, a complex series of events occurs that eventually leads to cell-degranulation and the release of histamine (and other chemical mediators) from the mast cell or basophil. Once released, histamine can react with local or widespread tissues through histamine receptors. Histamine, acting on H1-receptors, produces pruritis, vasodilatation, hypotension, flushing, headache, tachycardia, and bronchoconstriction. Histamine also increases vascular permeability and potentiates pain. Mequitazine is a histamine H1 antagonist. It competes with histamine for the normal H1-receptor sites on effector cells of the gastrointestinal tract, blood vessels and respiratory tract. It provides effective, temporary relief of sneezing, watery and itchy eyes, and runny nose due to hay fever and other upper respiratory allergies.\n",

For example approximately 50 percent of children will experience two RSV infections by the age of two.\n",

Motofen(R) is a brand mixture which combines atropine sulfate and difenoxin hydrochloride. It is approved by the FDA to treat acute and chronic diarrhea. \nDifenoxin is an active metabolite of the anti-diarrheal drug, diphenoxylate, which is also used in combination with atropine in the brand mixture Lomotil(R). It works mostly in the periphery and activates opioid receptors in the intestine rather than the central nervous system (CNS). [3] Difenoxin is also closely related to loperamide, but unlike loperamide it is still capable of crossing the blood brain barrier to produce weak sedative and analgesic effects. However, the antidiarrheal potency of difenoxin is much greater than its CNS effects, which makes it an attractive alternative to other opioids.\n",

In patients with acute ulcerative colitis, as induction of toxic megacolon is possible, and thus use of Motofen(R) is cautioned. \nMotofen(R) has been assigned pregnancy category C by the FDA, and is to be used only when the potential benefits outweigh the potential risk to the fetus.

It consists of levothyroxine sodium (thyroxine, T4) and liothyronine sodium (triiodothyronine, T3) in a 4 to 1 ratio by weight. Liotrix was developed when it was believed that serum levels of both T4 and T3 were maintained by direct thyroidal secretion. It is now known that the thyroid gland secretes approximately ten times more T4 than T3 and that 80% of serum T3 is derived from deiodination of T4 in peripheral tissues. Administration of levothyroxine alone is sufficient for maintaining serum T4 and T3 levels in most patients and combination hormone replacement therapy generally offers no therapeutic advantage. In fact, administration of T3 may result in supratherapeutic levels of T3.\n",

        "pharmacodynamics": "Dantrolene is classified as a direct-acting skeletal muscle relaxant. It is currently the only specific and effective treatment for malignant hyperthermia. In isolated nerve-muscle preparation, Dantrium has been shown to produce relaxation by affecting the contractile response of the muscle at a site beyond the myoneural junction. In skeletal muscle, Dantrium dissociates excitation-contraction coupling, probably by interfering with the release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. In the anesthetic-induced malignant hyperthermia syndrome, evidence points to an intrinsic abnormality of skeletal muscle tissue. In selected humans, it has been postulated that “triggering agents” (e.g.,general anesthetics and depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents) produce a change within the cell which results in an elevated myoplasmic calcium. This elevated myoplasmic calcium activates acute cellular catabolic processes that cascade to the malignant hyperthermia crisis. It is hypothesized that addition of Dantrium to the “triggered” malignant hyperthermic muscle cell reestablishes a normal level of ionized calcium in the myoplasm.\n",

It is important to note that though the risk of bleeding with celecoxib is lower than with certain other NSAIDS, it exists nonetheless and caution must be observed when it is administered to those with a high risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.28\nA note on the risk of cardiovascular events\nSignificant concerns regarding the safety of COX-2 selective NSAIDs emerged in the early 2000s. Rofecoxib, another member of the COX-2 inhibitor drug class, also known as Vioxx, was withdrawn from the market due to prothrombotic cardiovascular risks.30 Following an FDA Advisory Committee meeting in 2005, in which data from large clinical outcome trials were evaluated, the FDA concluded that the risk for cardiovascular thrombotic events for both COX-2 selective NSAIDs and nonselective NSAIDs was evident.23 It was determined that the benefits of celecoxib treatment, however, outweighed the risks.30 Postmarketing cardiovascular outcomes trial (PRECISION) revealed that the lowest possible dose of celecoxib was similar in cardiovascular safety to moderate strength doses of both naproxen and ibuprofen. Patients who had previous cardiovascular events including acute MI, coronary revascularization, or coronary stent insertion were not evaluated in the trial. It is not advisable to administer NSAIDS to these groups of patients.23\n",

NSAIDs consist of agents that are structurally unrelated; the NSAID chemical classification of indometacin is an indole-acetic acid derivative with the chemical name 1- (p-chlorobenzoyl)25-methoxy-2-methylindole-3-acetic acid.1 The pharmacological effect of indometacin is not fully understood, however, it is thought to be mediated through potent and nonselective inhibition of the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX), which is the main enzyme responsible for catalyzes the rate-limiting step in prostaglandin and thromboxane biosynthesis via the arachidonic acid (AA) pathway. Indometacin was first discovered in 1963 and it was first approved for use in the U.S. by the Food and Drug Administration in 1965, 10 along with other acetic acid derivatives such as diclofenac and sulindac that were also developed during the 1960s.1 Since then, indometacin has been extensively studied in clinical trials as one of the most potent NSAIDs in blocking prostaglandin synthesis and was among the first NSAIDs to be used in the symptomatic treatment of migraine and for headaches that eventually became known as “indomethacin-responsive” headache disorders.1 \nMost commonly used in rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, osteoarthritis, acute shoulder pains, and acute gouty arthritis, indometacin is currently available as oral capsules as well as other methods of administration, including rectal and intravenous formulations. Intravenous indometacin is administered to close a hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus, as indicated by clinical evidence, in premature infants.14 Ophthalmic indometacin has been studied and used in the symptomatic treatment of postoperative ocular inflammation and pain and/or complications after cataract surgery. Although deemed effective in reducing ocular inflammation in clinical studies, topical NSAIDs were also associated with a potential reduction in corneal sensitivity accompanied by an increased risk of superficial punctate keratitis and subjective symptoms of discomfort, including pain, burning or pricking, or a tingling sensation after instillation into the cul‐de‐sac.6\n",

        "pharmacodynamics": "Indometacin is an NSAID with analgesic and antipyretic properties that exerts its pharmacological effects by inhibiting the synthesis of factors involved in pain, fever, and inflammation. Its therapeutic action does not involve pituitary-adrenal stimulation.13 Indometacin primarily works by suppressing inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis by providing relief of pain as well as reducing fever, swelling, and tenderness. This effectiveness has been demonstrated by a reduction in the extent of joint swelling, the average number of joints displaying symptoms of inflammation, and the severity of morning stiffness. Increased mobility was demonstrated by a decrease in total walking time and by improved functional capability seen as an increase in grip strength.13 In clinical trials, indometacin was shown to be effective in relieving the pain, reducing the fever, swelling, redness, and tenderness of acute gouty arthritis. Due to its pharmacological actions, the use of indometacin is associated with the risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction and stroke, as well as gastrointestinal effects such as bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach or intestines.13\nIn a study of healthy individuals, acute oral and intravenous indometacin therapy resulted in a transiently diminished basal and CO2 stimulated cerebral blood flow; this effect disappeared in one study after one week of oral treatment.13 The clinical significance of this effect has not been established. Compared to other NSAIDs, it is suggested that indometacin is a more potent vasoconstrictor that is more consistent in decreasing cerebral blood flow and inhibiting CO2 reactivity.1 There have been studies that show indometacin directly inhibiting neuronal activity to some extent in the trigeminocervical complex after either superior salivatory nucleus or dural stimulation.1\n",

Onset of significant analgesia usually occurs between 15 and 30 minutes after oral administration, and duration of action is usually three hours or longer. Onset and duration of action and the degree of pain relief are related both to dose and the severity of pretreatment pain. Pentazocine weakly antagonizes the analgesic effects of morphine and meperidine; in addition, it produces incomplete reversal of cardiovascular, respiratory, and behavioral depression induced by morphine and meperidine. Pentazocine has about 1/50 the antagonistic activity of nalorphine. It also has sedative activity.\n",

        "pharmacodynamics": "Hydroxocobalamin is a synthetic, injectable form of Vitamin B12. Hydroxocobalamin is actually a precursor of two cofactors or vitamins (Vitamin B12 and Methylcobalamin) which are involved in various biological systems in man. Vitamin B12 is required for the conversion of methylmalonate to succinate. Deficiency of this enzyme could therefore interfere with the production of lipoprotein in myelin sheath tissue and so give rise to neurological lesions. The second cofactor, Methylcobalamin, is necessary for the conversion of homocysteine to methionine which is essential for the metabolism of folic acid. Deficiency of tetrahydrafolate leads to reduced synthesis of thymidylate resulting in reduced synthesis of DNA which is essential for cell maturation. Vitamin B12 is also concerned in the maintenance of sulphydryl groups in reduced form, deficiency leading to decreased amounts of reduced SH content of erythrocytes and liver cells. Overall, vitamin B12 acts as a coenzyme for various metabolic functions, including fat and carbohydrate metabolism and protein synthesis. It is necessary for growth, cell replication, hematopoiesis, and nucleoprotein as well as myelin synthesis. This is largely due to its effects on metabolism of methionine folic acid, and malonic acid.\n",

Oliceridine has the potential to cause severe respiratory depression, especially in patients who are elderly, cachectic, debilitated, or who otherwise have chronically impaired pulmonary function. In addition, severe respiratory depression or sedation may occur in patients with increased intracranial pressure, head injury, brain tumour, or impaired consciousness. Patients with adrenal insufficiency or severe hypotension may require treatment alterations or discontinuation. Finally, oliceridine has been demonstrated to prolong the QTc interval and has not been properly evaluated beyond a maximum daily dose of 27 mg; it is recommended not to exceed 27 mg per day.15\n",

Additionally, the combination of encorafenib and binimetinib delayed the emergence of resistance in BRAF V600E mutant human melanoma xenografts in mice compared to either drug alone. In a BRAF V600E mutant NSCLC patient-derived xenograft model in mice, coadministration of encorafenib and binimetinib resulted in greater anti-tumor activity compared to binimetinib alone, with respect to tumor growth inhibition. Increased tumor growth delay after dosing cessation was also observed with the co-administration compared to either drug alone.5\nIn the setting of BRAF-mutant CRC, induction of EGFR-mediated MAPK pathway activation has been identified as a mechanism of resistance to BRAF inhibitors. Combinations of a BRAF inhibitor and agents targeting EGFR have been shown to overcome this resistance mechanism in nonclinical models.

        "background": "Ivermectin is a semi-synthetic antiparasitic medication derived from avermectins, a class of highly-active broad-spectrum antiparasitic agents isolated from the fermentation products of Streptomyces avermitilis.8 Ivermectin itself is a mixture of two avermectins, comprising roughly 90% 5-O-demethyl-22,23-dihydroavermectin A1a (22,23-dihydroavermectin B1a) and 10% 5-O-demethyl-25-de(1-methylpropyl)-22,23-dihydro­-25-(1-methylethyl)avermectin A1a (22,23-dihydroavermectin B1b).8\nIvermectin is mainly used in humans in the treatment of onchocerciasis, but may also be effective against other worm infestations (such as strongyloidiasis, ascariasis, trichuriasis and enterobiasis). Applied topically, it may be used in the treatment of head lice infestation.\nWith the advent of 2020 and the COVID-19 pandemic, ivermectin began garnering notoriety due to its off-label use for the prophylaxis and treatment of COVID-19. While studies are still ongoing, much of the evidence for ivermectin in COVID-19 relies on pre-print in vitro data, and the clinical utility of this data remains unclear. Due to a number of factors - for example, the relatively low number of patients per trial and the speed at which these trials were conducted - studies on the use of ivermectin in COVID-19 have been fraught with statistical errors and accusations of plagiarism.9,5 In addition, the use of aggregate patient data in large-scale meta-analyses (as opposed to individual patient data (IPD)) has been shown to disguise otherwise blatant data errors, such as extreme terminal digit bias and the duplication of blocks of patient records.5 \nUntil high-quality, peer-reviewed data regarding both the safety and efficacy of ivermectin for COVID-19 in humans becomes available, the use of ivermectin for these purposes should be avoided in favour of thoroughly-vetted therapies (e.g. COVID-19 vaccines like Comirnaty).\n",

The antibacterial activity of amdinocillin is derived from its ability to bind specifically and avidly to Penicillin Binding Protein-2 (PBP 2). Amdinocillin is active alone against many gram-negative organisms. Pseudomonas and non-fermenting gram-negative bacteria, however, are usually resistant. Amdinocillin, in combination with many beta-lactams, exhibits marked synergy against many enterobacteriaceae. No such synergy can be demonstrated for gram-positive organisms or pseudomonas species. Amdinocillin is not beta-lactamase stable. Organisms which produce high levels of plasma-mediated beta-lactamase are resistant to the drug. Co-administration of probenecid results in markedly elevated plasma levels of amdinocillin and delays its excretion.\n",

        "background": "N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors (NMDARs) are members of the ionotropic glutamate receptor family, with key roles in brain development and neurological function.1,2 NMDARs are heterotetramers that typically involve a dimer of dimers of both GluN1 and GluN2A-D subunits, with each subunit itself composed of an N-terminal domain (NTD), a ligand-binding domain (LBD), a transmembrane domain, and a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. Binding at the LBD of the agonists glycine (or D-serine) to the GluN1 subunits and of glutamate to the GluN2 subunits is a regulatory mechanism for channel activation. In addition, allosteric modulators are known to bind at the NTDs and form another layer of regulation.1,2 One such allosteric regulator is ifenprodil, which was first shown to bind the NMDARs in the 1990s, and specifically to those NMDARs containing the GluN2B subunit.3 Further studies elucidated that ifenprodil binds strongly at the inter-subunit interface of adjacent GluN1 and GluN2B NTDs, where it acts as a non-competitive antagonist.1,2\nAlthough ifenprodil has received considerable interest in its potential neuromodulatory activities in psychiatric conditions, including dependency4 and depression,5 it has also been shown to have an immunomodulatory effect.5,6 In an unbiased screen for compounds capable of reducing cell death induced by infection with the influenza strain H5N1, ifenprodil was found to have a protective effect against H5N1-induced lung damage, in part through its ability to alleviate the H5N1-induced cytokine storm and reduce pulmonary infiltration of neutrophils, natural killer cells, and T cells.6 Ifenprodil is being investigated for its potential utility in treating COVID-19 in an ongoing phase 2b/3 clinical trial (NCT04382924).7\n",

It inhibits DNA topoisomerase II, thereby ultimately inhibiting DNA synthesis. Etoposide is cell cycle dependent and phase specific, affecting mainly the S and G2 phases. Two different dose-dependent responses are seen. At high concentrations (10 µg/mL or more), lysis of cells entering mitosis is observed. At low concentrations (0.3 to 10 µg/mL), cells are inhibited from entering prophase. It does not interfere with microtubular assembly. The predominant macromolecular effect of etoposide appears to be the induction of DNA strand breaks by an interaction with DNA-topoisomerase II or the formation of free radicals.\n",

It is also indicated in adults to reduce the risk of recurrence of DVT and PE in patients who have been previously treated and for the prophylaxis of DVT and PE in patients who have undergone hip replacement surgery. Lastly, it is indicated in pediatric patients between eight and 18 years of age for the treatment of venous thromboembolic events (VTE) in patients who have been treated with a parenteral anticoagulant for at least 5 days and to reduce the risk of recurrence of VTE in patients who have been previously treated.19\nDabigatran etexilate is also approved by the EMA to prevent VTE in adult patients.

Premature discontinuation of dabigatran, in the absence of an alternative anticoagulant, also carries an increased risk of thromboembolic events. Due to the risk of an epidural or spinal hematoma, dabigatran should generally not be used in the context of neuraxial anesthesia or spinal puncture; if such use is unavoidable, careful monitoring should be employed. Dabigatran should not be used in patients with prosthetic heart valves due to an increased occurrence of major bleeding and thromboembolic events. Dabigatran is a substrate of the P-gp transporter and should generally not be administered together with P-gp inhibitors or inducers, especially in patients with impaired renal function. Lastly, dabigatran or any other direct-acting oral anticoagulant should not be administered in patients with triple-positive antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) due to an increased risk of recurrent thrombotic events. In case of the need for emergency reversal, idarucizumab is available for use in adult patients; the safety and efficacy of idarucizumab has not been established in pediatric patients yet, for whom reversal may be achieved through hemodialysis, prothrombin complex concentrates, or recombinant FVIIa. However, none of these have been sufficiently evaluated in clinical trials.18,19\n",

        "pharmacodynamics": "Alprazolam is a benzodiazepine that binds γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type-A receptors (GABAARs) to enhance their inhibitory effect on neurotransmission, specifically in the brain.18,19 Concomitant use with opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death; patients taking benzodiazepines and opioids concurrently may require lower doses of one or both medications, depending on their clinical situation. Patients with pre-existing impaired respiratory function are at increased risk of adverse effects including death during treatment with benzodiazepines. In addition, due to its CNS depressant effects, patients taking alprazolam should avoid operating heavy machinery or driving and should avoid other CNS depressants such as alcohol. As with other benzodiazepines, alprazolam carries a risk of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which is higher in predisposed individuals and may require strict monitoring. Cessation of therapy may result in acute or protracted withdrawal symptoms, which may be life-threatening; the patient dose should be gradually tapered whenever discontinuation or reduced dosage are necessary. Newborns born to mothers using alprazolam later in pregnancy may suffer from sedation and withdrawal symptoms. As CYP3A is required for the initial step in alprazolam metabolism, alprazolam is contraindicated in patients taking strong CYP3A inhibitors, such as ketoconazole and itraconazole; milder CYP3A inhibitors still necessitate alprazolam dosage adjustments. Lastly, benzodiazepines may have negative effects, such as panic disorders, increased suicide incidence, and episodes of mania/hypomania, in patients suffering from depression.4,7,18,19\n",

It has also been reported an inhibition of CLL cell survival and proliferation as well as an impaired in cell migration and a reduction in the secretion of chemokines such as CCL3 and CCL4. The latter effect has been shown to produce regression in xenograft mouse models.6\nClinical studies for relapsed/refractory CLL in phase I and II showed an approximate 71% of overall response rate.7,8. In the case of relapsed/refractory mantle cell lymphoma, approximately 70% of the tested patients presented a partial or complete response.7,9. In clinical trials for relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, a partial response was found in between 15-20% of the patients studied; while for patients with relapsed/refractory Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, a partial response was observed in over 75% of the patients tested. Finally, for patients with relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma, a partial to complete response was obtained in approximately 54% of the patients.7\n",

The energy used by human cells requires the hydrolysis of 200 to 300 moles of ATP daily. This means that each ATP molecule is recycled 2000 to 3000 times during a single day.

        "background": "Estradiol Dienanthate is a pro-drug ester of Estradiol, a naturally occurring hormone that circulates endogenously within the human body. Estradiol is the most potent form of all mammalian estrogenic steroids and acts as the major female sex hormone. As a pro-drug of estradiol, estradiol benzoate therefore has the same downstream effects within the body through binding to the Estrogen Receptor (ER) including ERα and ERβ subtypes, which are located in various tissues including in the breasts, uterus, ovaries, skin, prostate, bone, fat, and brain.\nEstradiol is commonly produced with an ester side-chain as endogenous estradiol has very low oral bioavailability on its own (2-10%). First-pass metabolism by the gut and the liver quickly degrades the estradiol molecule before it gets a chance to enter systemic circulation and exert its estrogenic effects 9. Esterification of estradiol aims to improves absorption and bioavailability after oral administration (such as with Estradiol valerate) or to sustain release from depot intramuscular injections (such as with Estradiol Cypionate) through improved lipophilicity. Following absorption, the esters are cleaved, resulting in the release of endogenous estradiol, or 17β-estradiol. Ester pro-drugs of estradiol are therefore considered to be bioidentical forms of estrogen 10.\nEstradiol dienanthate is not currently available in any commercially available products in Canada or the US.\n",
